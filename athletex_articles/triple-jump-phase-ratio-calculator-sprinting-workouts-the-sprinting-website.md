## How To Use The Information From This Calculator
There are a couple different ways you can make use of the calculations provided by this triple jump phase ratio calculator.
### Practicing Optimal Triple Jump Phase Distances
One way you can use this calculator is to assess the approximate distances that your triple jump phases should cover.
This can be used at practice by setting up zones at various distances to work on the rhythm and phase distribution of your triple jump.
For example, say that you can jump 40 feet with a short approach triple jump, and you have a balanced jumping style. You could set up cones at 14 feet for the hop, 12 feet for the step phase, and 14 feet for the jump phase.
You can then perform short approach jumps, aiming to have each phase of your jump take place from the cones placed on the runway. This allows you to practice proper rhythm, timing, and phase distribution while performing short approach triple jumps.
The same can be done with your [**standing triple jump**](https://sprintingworkouts.com/blogs/jumping/standing-triple-jump "standing triple jump"), or longer approach triple jumps.
### Assessing Inefficient Triple Jump Distribution
Another way to use this calculator is to see if your jumping style is efficient or not.
For example, say that you are a hop dominant jumper, but your step and jump phases are much shorter than what the calculator would estimate based on selecting the hop dominant option.
This would indicate that your hop may be too aggressive, and is leading to you losing speed in the subsequent phases of the jump.
To fix this, you could once again place cones at the distanced output by the calculator, and see if aiming for these phase ratios improves your ability to maintain speed throughout the jump.
