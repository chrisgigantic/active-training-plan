## Speed Coaching That Delivers
Are you or someone you care about interested in running faster? Whether you run the sprint events in track & field, play a sport that requires speed on the field, or you want to be faster from a health and self-defense standpoint, my speed training service based in Phoenix will give you the results you're looking for.
Most speed training coaches have their athletes run long, grueling sprints which do not teach them to sprint any faster. These workouts might have a good metabolic effect as it relates to fitness, but they do not effectively develop speed.
Instead, I focus on developing high quality skills that directly relate to sprinting fast, making for a more effective and enjoyable workout. Getting faster does not have to be a brutal experience, I promise you that!
## Sprint Training & Strength Training Available
Science shows us that getting faster is not only about sprinting fast, but also getting stronger and more powerful. As such, we have a private gym location where you can receive strength training that compliments the speed training workouts.
Not only do we have a location available, but more importantly we have the knowledge and expertise to know when, why, and how to apply a certain speed training stimulus to the athlete. We treat athletes as individuals with unique needs, and we fit our program to the athlete, not the other way around.
## Running Coach Versus Sprint Coach
Taking a speed athlete to a running coach is like taking your high performance vehicle to the Jiffy Lube for engine work - they do not have the tools or expertise to properly serve your needs.
The typical running coach in Phoenix will have you or your youth athlete running miles of long, slow runs, doing nothing but building endurance at the expense of speed development.
For athletes to sprint fast, they need to train in very specific, methodical ways. Instead of using high running volumes, we focus on developing sprinting skills at high intensities, targeting the specific qualities needed to sprint fast rather than hammering you with general training that will not transfer to faster sprinting performance.
## Speed Training In Phoenix For Everybody
We believe that anybody, whether they are an athlete or not, can benefit from working on their ability to sprint. Not only is sprinting good for your health and fitness levels, it can also save your life.
Phoenix is a bustling place with fast moving cars and many people. Imagine that you are walking down the street, and a car has veered toward you or a threatening individual is trying to accost you. What would you do in this situation? If you have developed your sprinting through speed training, you would be better able to evade any threat and keep yourself safe.
## Fat Loss Training In Phoenix
Another group of people that we serve with our speed training in Phoenix is people who want to pursue fat loss.

We use interval training that is appropriate for you, whatever level of fitness you have and regardless of your goals.
