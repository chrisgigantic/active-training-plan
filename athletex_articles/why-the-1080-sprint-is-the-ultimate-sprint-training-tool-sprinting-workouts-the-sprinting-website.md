## **What is the 1080 Sprint?**
The 1080 Sprint is a robotic, motorized training device for athletes with a wide range of capabilities. It is most commonly known for its use in resisted sprinting, assisted sprinting, overspeed sprinting, and for its abilities for extracting important athletic performance data.

It can also be used for strength training, jump training, load-velocity profiling, and for injury rehabilitation.

## **How does the 1080 Sprint work?**
The 1080 Sprint uses an electric motor to generate force which is applied to a cable that is attached to the athlete via a hip belt or harness.
For resisted sprinting, users can choose to apply a consistent, progressive, or decreasing load throughout the sprint. Loads can also be specified as either isotonic or normal, allowing you to mimic or avoid the inertial effects normally seen in mass based loading.
For assisted sprinting, the same approach can be used. Assisted sprinting can be very beneficial for athletes as it allows for a higher volume of sprinting to be performed without tiring the athlete out as much. Athletes can be assisted during acceleration or maximal velocity zones, depending on the training goal.
As the athlete performs exercise, the 1080 sprint will record data that is extremely useful for discerning the abilities and needs of an athlete.
## **1080 Sprint Features**
Here are the main features of the 1080 Sprint:
### **Adjustable Resistance**
Using the touch screen, users of the 1080 Sprint can adjust loads up to 30kg, or 66lb. This can be applied as resistance like a **[sprint sled](https://sprintingworkouts.com/blogs/training/sprint-sled "sprint sled")** , or assistance such as overspeed sprinting.
### **Variable Resistance**
The 1080 Sprint’s robotic system allows for variable loads to be applied with the same sprint. Whether you want the load to get heavier or lighter as you go, the 1080 sprint can be dialed in to do exactly what you want.  

### **1080 Load Modes**
Users can choose from three modes that determine how the 1080 Sprint system reacts under load. 
#### **Isotonic Mode**
This mode eliminates the inertial effects of a sled by keeping the load the same throughout the movement.
#### Normal Mode
This mimics the inertial effects of massed based loading, such that the load will decrease as you accelerate, similar to pulling a sled.
#### No Flying Weight (NFW) Mode
This mode gives you loading similar to normal mode, mimicking the inertial qualities of mass based loading, but eliminates slack so you can perform athletic movements without issue.  

**Speed Limits:** The 1080 Sprint allows for speed limits, such as to perform assisted sprinting to a specific velocity or to resist an athlete to a certain speed. This can also be used for isokinetic strength training, such as would be used to rehabilitate an injury and avoid going too fast.  
**Speed Graphs:** The 1080 Sprint displays a graph showing an athlete’s speed, force production, power output, and acceleration ability. This provides powerful data insights which can supercharge your ability to coach.  
**Auto Distance Setting:** The Auto Distance setting allows you to test sprints to a specified distance, regardless of an athlete’s starting point.  
**Load Velocity Profiling:** The Load Velocity profiling feature enables users to assess an athlete's ability to move under different loads, allow you to assess their needs as an athlete. Whether you want to test sprints, vertical jumps, horizontal jumps, or single limb movements, the 1080 sprint lets you train and assess these movements to help guide you coaching.  

### **Left and Right Symmetry Testing**
The 1080 Sprint can be used to test concentric and eccentric strength abilities of all limbs, allowing you to identify asymmetries and target them through training  

### **Change of Direction (CoD)**
This feature allows you to look at movement abilities graphically, so you can assess how quickly an athlete changes direction, how their eccentric and concentric abilities compare, and identify what the athlete needs to develop.
## Frequently Asked Questions About The 1080 Sprint
### What are the benefits of using the 1080 Sprint in training?
The 1080 Sprint offers a wide range of benefits that cannot be encompassed by a single article.
Because you can specify loads, loading modes, and the distance over which these loads are applied, the 1080 Sprint gives you options for training which are not achievable through normal training tools such as sprinting sleds or normal weights.
Say that you want to perform a higher volume of speed training without burning out an athlete, you could apply an assistive load to the athlete during acceleration to save them energy, then reduce the assistive load as they go through a flying sprint zone. This would allow an athlete to perform more sprints at maximal velocity, giving them an opportunity to train sprint specific skills at higher volumes without burning themselves out.
In the case of an athlete who needs to improve their first few steps of the sprint, resistive loads could be applied to the athlete early in the sprint, with the load reducing as they sprint. Similarly, you could apply resistance in mid-acceleration for an athlete who starts well but does not continue to accelerate effectively.
Ultimately, the 1080 Sprint opens up a world of opportunity for training options which are not achievable through other training tools.
### How does the 1080 Sprint compare to other training equipment for speed and power development?
The 1080 Sprint does not really compare to other pieces of training equipment for speed and power development, because it stands head and shoulders above all of it.
Being able to record crucial data insights and develop training to target the needs of athletes makes the 1080 an item that cannot be replaced by other equipment.
### Can the 1080 Sprint be used for sports other than track and field, such as football or soccer?
Yes! The 1080 Sprint is used by many sports, including soccer, football, baseball, basketball, and volleyball.
Whether you want to work on sprinting, jumping, or change of direction drills, the 1080 Sprint can give you new opportunities to train and assess athletes.
### How often should the 1080 Sprint be incorporated into a training program?
The 1080 Sprint can be used in a training program multiple times throughout the week.
For sprint training, the 1080 Sprint could be incorporated both in acceleration training and speed training. Resisted sprints could be used on acceleration days, whereas assisted sprints can be used in maximal velocity training sessions.
Additionally, the 1080 Sprint can be used for jump training, strength training, or for rehabilitation. As long as you have the 1080 Sprint with you at the track or the gym, you could find ways to use it every single day.
### How much does the 1080 Sprint cost and is it worth the investment for a gym or training facility?
The 1080 Sprint costs $19,300, and the yearly subscription costs $62.50 per month ($750 annually).
While more expensive than a sled or the Run Rocket, the 1080 Sprint gives you access to unique training options which can take your training to another level.
Because of the unique nature of this machine, it is possible that you could apply for a business loan to fund its purchase, allowing you to spread the payments out over time rather than spending a huge chunk at once.
### Are there any safety concerns or precautions to keep in mind when using the 1080 Sprint?
Yes, there are some precautions you should take. First, ensure you are warmed up properly before use and that you follow the directions and intended used of the 1080 Sprint.
Make sure that before you add resistance or assistance to an athlete’s sprinting, that you first assess how much load or velocity they can safely handle.
I would suggest avoiding overspeed training until both the coach and the athlete are very familiar with the machine, what assisted sprinting feels like, and are very clear on what overspeed sprinting velocities are safe to attain.
### How accurate is the data tracking and performance metrics provided by the 1080 Sprint?
The data produced by the 1080 Sprint is very accurate, and has been validated by [scientific research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.824606/abstract).
### Can the 1080 Sprint be used by athletes of all levels, from beginner to professional?
The 1080 Sprint can be used by athletes of any age or skill level. Because you can adjust the resistance precisely, and you can use the 1080 for a variety of exercises, there are no limitations on who can benefit from this machine.
