#  Online Training For Athletes 
## Team X - Online Speed & Strength Training
[**Team X**](https://market.teambuildr.com/programs/sprintingworkouts/short-sprints "online sprint training") is my online training group. The training is designed to make you faster, stronger, and more explosive.
What you get:
  * 3-5 workouts per week
  * Video examples & text descriptions of exercises
  * Sprint training
  * Strength training
  * Plyometric training
  * Core training
  * Access to my discord server
  * Cost: $29/mo


These workouts are best for athletes with some training experience, such as having sprinted in training and lifted weights before.
The year is designed in accordance with the America track season, with off-season training taking place in the late summer, fall, and early winter. Training for the competitive season starts in the late winter and lasts through mid-summer.
While this program is designed primarily for athletes who want to sprint fast between 60 and 200 meters, athletes who want to be faster over short distances will still benefit. You can ask about modifications to training in my discord server, which you will be linked to once you [**sign up for training**](https://market.teambuildr.com/programs/sprintingworkouts/short-sprints "online speed training").
### What Does The App Look Like?

### Do you offer refunds?
No refunds are offered, but you can cancel your training service at any time. Due to the proprietary nature of our training programs, all payments are final. The only time refunds are offered are for double payment.
### What if I want an even more personalized service?
I have a limited number of 1-on-1 coaching spots available. These are significantly more expensive, and reserved for athletes who want more attention but are generally self sufficient. If this is something you are interested in, reach out to discuss the details.
