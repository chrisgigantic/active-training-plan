# Strength & Size In One Program
Would you like to be stronger? How about more muscular? If so, this is the program for you.
Based upon the tenets of powerlifting and bodybuilding training, this ATHLETE.X powerbuilding program is specifically designed to maximize strength and hypertrophy gains in athletes of all levels.
## What Is Powerbuilding?
Powerbuilding is a cross between two training styles:
  * **Power** lifting
  * Body**building**


## **How Are The Workouts Set Up?**
With this program, each workout starts with a primary movement which is focused on developing savage levels of strength. Using moderate to high loads, a large number of sets and a smaller number of repetitions, the beginning of these workouts is built to drive up your strength levels through the roof.
Once the main lift is done, you move on to hand picked bodybuilding exercises which will not only enhance your physique, but help drive your strength up even further by growing muscles in areas that are vital for overall strength.
One day per week, you will work power development, ensuring that you stay fast and explosive throughout the duration of this program. Additionally, down weeks are built in to ensure that you avoid over training and can continue to improve for the entire duration of the program.
## What Is This Program Based On?
This program is very similar to what I, Cody Bidlow, do in my own workouts. Right now, my focus is on developing strength and a more muscular physique, so I follow a powerbuilding approach. 
Through years of trial and error utilizing this type of training, I have developed a solid understanding of how to structure training for the goals of strength and a muscular physique.
