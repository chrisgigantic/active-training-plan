To measure your standing triple jump, use a tape measure and record the distance from the starting line to where you landed.
This exercise is a fantastic way to introduce the triple jumping technique, train jumpers for specific jumping skills, and be included in plyometric workouts for sprinters and other athletes.
## Differences Between the Standard Triple Jump and Standing Triple Jump
While the standing triple jump shares similarities with the standard triple jump, there are key differences between the two.
The most notable difference is the starting position – the standing triple jump is performed from a stationary start, whereas the standard triple jump begins with a running approach. This distinction makes the standing triple jump an excellent training tool for focusing on the hop, step, and jump phases without the added complexity of a running approach.
Additionally, the standing triple jump is often performed with a double leg hop phase similar to a broad jump, whereas the standard triple jump is performed with a single leg hop phase.
## Benefits Of The Standing Triple Jump
The standing triple jump serves as both an assessment tool and a training exercise for various athletic skills.
The standing triple jump has many benefits on aspects of sports performance, such as:
  * Explosive power
  * Single-leg jumping ability
  * Joint stiffness
  * Eccentric strength
  * Elasticity
  * Single leg strength
  * Jumping technique


By incorporating the standing triple jump into training routines, athletes and coaches can develop these skills and monitor progress over time.
## Standing Triple Jump Standards for Male and Female Athletes
Achieving specific performance standards in the standing triple jump is a common goal for athletes across different skill levels.
  * **Elite Male Jumpers:** 11 Meters
  * **Elite Female Jumpers:** 9 Meters
  * **Male Division 1 Jumpers:** 10 meters
  * **Female Division 1 Jumpers:** 8 Meters
  * **High School Male Jumpers:** 9 Meters
  * **High School Female Jumpers:** 7 Meters


These benchmarks provide athletes with targets to work towards and help track improvement over time.
## Mastering Standing Triple Jump Technique
### Proper Posture and Pelvic Tilt
An upright posture and neutral pelvic tilt are essential for optimal performance in the standing triple jump.
Maintaining proper body alignment throughout the exercise allows for efficient energy transfer, improved balance, and reduced risk of injury.
To achieve this, focus on keeping the chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged during each phase of the jump.
If you can maintain proper posture, your legs will work more effectively, and you will jump farther.
### Full-Foot Landings for Support and Injury Prevention
Landing on the whole foot during the hop, step, and jump phases provides ample support, power, and stability while also helping to prevent injury.
To ensure full-foot landings, athletes should concentrate on contacting the ground with the entire foot rather than just the toes or heels, emphasizing dorsiflexion while in the air.
This technique allows for better force absorption and more effective propulsion into the subsequent phases of the jump.
### Arm Swing Variations
The arm swing plays a crucial role in generating momentum and maintaining balance throughout the standing triple jump. There are several arm swing variations that athletes can utilize, including:
  * **Double arm shift:** Both arms swing simultaneously in the same direction.
  * **Single arm shift:** One arm swings forward while the other swings backward, with the arms moving in the opposite direction of the leg on the same side of the body.


Experimenting with different arm swing techniques can help athletes discover which approach works best for their unique body mechanics and jumping style.
### Proper Landing Techniques for Different Surfaces
The type of surface on which the standing triple jump is performed can influence the landing technique.
When performing the exercise into a jump pit, athletes should land as they would during an actual triple or long jump, focusing on achieving maximum distance.
If the standing triple jump is executed on grass or another soft surface, athletes should land softly on both feet at the end of the jump to minimize impact and reduce the risk of injury.
## Improving Standing Triple Jump Performance
### Practice and Repetition
As with any athletic skill, practice, and repetition are crucial for improving standing triple jump performance.
Regularly incorporating this exercise into training routines allows athletes to refine their technique, build confidence, and develop a better understanding of their jumping mechanics.
As you continue to practice the standing triple jump, you should be able to increase your distance by multiple feet.
### Plyometric Exercises
In addition to practicing the standing triple jump itself, incorporating other plyometric exercises into training programs can help improve overall jumping ability.
Some effective plyometric exercises for enhancing standing triple jump performance include:
  * **[Alternate leg bounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmW42ZFUrGU "alternate leg bounds")**
  * **[Single leg bounds](https://youtube.com/shorts/HOvePxzD_eA "single leg bounds")**
  * **[Pogo hops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalkJJ6WhGo "pogo hops")**
  * **[Standing Long Jump](https://sprintingworkouts.com/blogs/jumping/standing-long-jump "standing long jump")**


These exercises focus on developing explosive power, joint stiffness, and eccentric strength – all essential components of a successful standing triple jump.
By getting better at jumping and hopping with general plyometric exercises, your body will be more prepared for the demands of the standing triple jump.
### Strength Training
[**Strength training**](https://sprintingworkouts.com/blogs/training/strength-training-for-sprinters "strength training") plays a significant role in improving standing triple jump performance.
By building a solid foundation of leg and core strength, athletes can generate more force during the hop, step, and jump phases.
Some practical strength training exercises for standing triple jump improvement include:
  * Squats
  * Lunges
  * Step-ups
  * Drop squats
  * Romanian Deadlifts
  * Hanging Leg Raises & Isometric Holds


Incorporating these exercises into a well-rounded training program can help athletes develop the necessary strength to excel in the standing triple jump.
### Sprint Training
Sprint training is another valuable tool for enhancing standing triple jump performance.
By improving overall speed and acceleration, athletes can improve their single leg power, angular velocity as the legs swing, higher rate of force development, elasticity, and enhanced muscle recruitment abilities, all of which lead to increased jumping distances.
Including [**sprinting**](https://sprintingworkouts.com/pages/sprinting "sprinting") into jump training routines can significantly boost standing triple jump capabilities.
### Progressing to More Specific Triple Jump Training
Once an athlete has mastered the standing triple jump, they can progress to more specific training exercises, such as short-approach triple jumps and approach runs.
These advanced exercises help athletes develop their skills further, eventually translating to improved performance in the standard triple jump event.
Because of the higher velocity of triple jumps from an approach, it is worth first performing standing triple jumps so that the athlete can prepare themselves with a less complex, lower intensity variation of the triple jump.
## Building an Effective Standing Triple Jump Training Program
### Plyometric Training
Incorporating plyometric training into an athlete's routine is essential for developing the explosive power and elasticity required for the standing triple jump.
Plyometric exercises, such as bounding, pogo hops, sprinting, and drop jumps, can help athletes increase their jumping ability and overall athleticism.
