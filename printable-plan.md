# Dynamic Training Plan

## General Warm-Up Routine (Approx. 15-20 Minutes)
The goal is to raise core body temperature, increase blood flow to muscles, activate key movement patterns, and prepare the nervous system for the specific work of the day.

### Group 1: Sprints & Jumps (Elementary, Secondary Sprints, Secondary LJ/TJ)
*This group needs to prepare for high-velocity, explosive movements. The focus is on dynamic mobility and neuromuscular activation.*
1.  **Pulse Raiser (3-5 mins):**
    *   2-3 laps of an open field at an easy jog.
    *   Incorporate variety: Side Shuffles, Carioca, Skipping, light jogging backwards.
2.  **Dynamic Mobility (5-7 mins):** (Perform each for ~10m)
    *   **Leg Swings:** 10x each leg (forward/backward and side-to-side).
    *   **Walking Knee Hugs:** Pull knee to chest, hold for a step.
    *   **Walking Quad Stretch:** Grab ankle and pull heel to glute.
    *   **Walking Lunges with a Twist:** Step into a lunge, twist torso over the front leg.
    *   **Open and Close the Gate:** Open the hips for more mobility.
3.  **Activation & Drills (5-7 mins):** (Perform each for ~20 yards)
    *   **A-March/A-Skip:** Focus on posture and striking under the hips.
    *   **B-Skip:** Emphasizes hamstring extension and pulling action.
    *   **Butt Kicks & High Knees:** For turnover and frequency.
    *   **Straight Leg Bounds:** For hamstring readiness.
4.  **Build-Ups (2-3 mins):**
    *   3-4 x 60-80m strides on the field.
    *   Gradually increase speed with each one: 60% -> 70% -> 80% -> 85% effort. Focus on relaxed, fast form.

### Group 2: Distance (Middle & Long Distance)
*This group needs to prepare the aerobic system while also ensuring good mechanics and mobility for efficient running.*
1.  **Pulse Raiser (5-10 mins):**
    *   Longer continuous jog than the sprint group (800m-1600m) at a very easy, conversational pace.
2.  **Dynamic Mobility (5 mins):**
    *   Same routine as the Sprints & Jumps group (Leg Swings, Lunges, etc.). Hip mobility is critical for running economy.
3.  **Activation & Drills (3-5 mins):** (Perform each for ~30-40 yards)
    *   A-Skips, High Knees, Butt Kicks. The focus here is less on explosive power and more on rhythm and efficient movement.
    *   Carioca and Side Shuffles to ensure lateral hip strength.
4.  **Build-Ups (2-3 mins):**
    *   4-6 x 100m strides on a flat stretch of road or field.
    *   Focus on feeling smooth, light, and efficient, building to about 5k race pace effort.

### Group 3: Throws
*This group needs to prepare for powerful, full-body rotational movements. The focus is on joint mobility (shoulders, hips, spine) and explosive activation.*
1.  **Pulse Raiser (3-5 mins):**
    *   1-2 laps easy jog, followed by skipping and light bounding.
2.  **Dynamic Mobility (7-10 mins):** *This is the most critical part for them.*
    *   **Arm Circles:** Forward and backward, small to large.
    *   **Trunk Twists:** Feet planted, rotating the torso.
    *   **Deep Squat Hold:** Sit in a full-depth bodyweight squat to open the hips.
    *   **Spiderman Lunge with T-Spine Rotation:** Lunge, place hand on ground, rotate chest to the sky.
    *   **Leg Swings & Hurdle Mobility:** Same as other groups.
3.  **Activation & Drills (3-5 mins):**
    *   **Standing Long Jumps:** 3-5 jumps for explosive power.
    *   **Backward Jumps & Stick (T1):** For deceleration strength.
    *   **"Mock Throws":** Use a soccer/volleyball or just their body to go through the throwing motion at 50% speed to warm up the specific pattern.
4.  **Build-Ups (1-2 mins):**
    *   2-3 x 20-30m sprints to get the full body firing.

# Day 1: Acceleration Foundation

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building the fundamental patterns of acceleration. The goal is to teach the body to push horizontally and drive forward effectively.

### Drills:

1.  **Falling Runs (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach the natural feeling of leaning into acceleration.
    *   **Execution:** Stand tall, feet together. Let your body fall forward, keeping a straight line from head to heels. When you feel you're about to lose balance, drive your legs out to "catch" yourself and sprint for 10-15 meters.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Don't bend at the waist," "Let gravity pull you," "Push the ground away behind you."

2.  **3-Point Starts (No Blocks):**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduce a more powerful starting position without the complexity of blocks.
    *   **Execution:** One hand down on the start line, feet staggered. The front foot should be about a foot behind the line, and the back knee is on the ground. On "set," lift the hips higher than the shoulders. On "go," drive out explosively.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 5-6 starts over 10-20 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Push with both feet," "Keep your head down for the first few steps," "Low and powerful."

3.  **10-20m Sprints:**
    *   **Purpose:** To practice the full acceleration pattern at maximum effort.
    *   **Execution:** After the 3-point start, continue sprinting at 95-100% effort for the full distance.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 sprints with full recovery (2-3 minutes) between each.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Every step should be powerful," "Drive your arms," "Stay relaxed."

# Day 2: General Endurance

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building a basic level of endurance in a fun and engaging way. This helps with recovery between sprints and builds overall fitness.

### Drills:

1.  **Keep the Pace Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop a sense of pace and improve aerobic capacity.
    *   **Execution:** This is best framed as a game. The coach blows a whistle, and the athletes have to run from one side of a field to the other (e.g., 50-60 meters) before the next whistle blows. The interval between whistles should be consistent (e.g., every 20 seconds).
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Run for a set duration, for example, 2 sets of 5 minutes with a 3-minute rest in between.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Run smooth and relaxed," "Don't start too fast," "Listen for the whistle!"

2.  **Whistle Game on a Field:**
    *   **Purpose:** A variation of the above that is less structured and more reactive.
    *   **Execution:** Athletes jog around a field. When the coach blows the whistle once, they have to sprint for 30 meters. When the coach blows the whistle twice, they have to jog back to the starting point.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Continue for 8-10 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Always be ready," "Listen carefully," "Have fun with it."

### Drills:

1.  **Step Over Drill (Walking) (T1 / T2, pg. 36):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop an active, cyclical leg action.
    *   **Execution:** This is performed at a walking pace. As you step forward, focus on pulling the toe up towards the shin and "stepping over" the opposite ankle. The foot should be moving backward as it strikes the ground. The focus is on creating a smooth, rolling motion.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 20-30 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Step over the opposite knee," "Keep your toes up," "Feel the foot pulling back under you."

2.  **Quick Skips (Linear) (T1 / T2, pg. 21):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop quick muscle response and a fast, reactive ground contact.
    *   **Execution:** Perform a standard skipping motion, but focus on taking short, sharp steps. Pop off the front of the foot as quickly as possible. This is a linear skip, moving straight forward.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 10-20 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Be light on your feet," "Pop off the ground," "Quick, quick, quick!"

3.  **"Running Tall" Cues:**
    *   **Purpose:** To establish a strong, upright posture which is essential for maximum velocity.
    *   **Execution:** During light jogs or strides, athletes should focus on running as if a string is pulling the top of their head towards the sky. Hips should be forward ("up"), and there should be no bending at the waist.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Run tall," "Hips to the sky," "Don't sit in the bucket."

    *   **Purpose:** To develop balance, stability, and control in the lower body.
    *   **Execution (Forward):** Stand on one foot. Hop forward and "stick" the landing on the same foot, holding the position for 3 seconds. Turn around and repeat with the other foot.
    *   **Execution (Backward):** Stand on one foot. Take a moderate hop backward and stick the landing on the same foot, holding for 3 seconds. Repeat with the other foot.
    *   **Sets/Rps:** 3 sets of 5 reps for each direction.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Maintain great body control," "Flex your knee and hip to absorb the landing," "Keep your core tight."

2.  **Animal Walks (Bear Crawl, etc.):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve total body strength, coordination, and mobility in a fun, engaging way.
    *   **Execution (Bear Crawl):** Start on hands and feet, with knees slightly bent and off the ground. Crawl forward by moving the opposite arm and leg simultaneously (e.g., right arm and left leg). Keep your back flat and hips low.
    *   **Other examples:** Crab walk, inchworm, frog jumps.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform for a set distance, like 15-20 meters, for 2-3 sets.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay low," "Keep your core engaged," "Try to be quiet."

3.  **Pillars (T1 / T2, pg. 62):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build core strength and stability.
    *   **Execution:** This is a standard plank. Pull the elbows under the shoulders, with toes pulled up toward the shins. Lift the hips so the body is in a straight line from ear to ankle.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Hold the position for 10 to 30 seconds. Complete 3 sets.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Don't let your hips drop," "Don't stick your butt in the air," "Squeeze your glutes."

    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform for 10-20 yards, then switch directions. Do 2-3 sets in each direction.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep your hips moving," "Stay light on your feet," "Exaggerate the crossover step."

3.  **Skill-Based Tag Game:**
    *   **Purpose:** To apply athletic movements in a fun, reactive, and competitive setting.
    *   **Execution (Example: "Freeze Tag"):** A classic game of tag. When a player is tagged, they must "freeze" in an athletic position (e.g., a lunge, a single-leg balance). Other players can "unfreeze" them by crawling under their legs or performing another designated action. This encourages agility, changes of direction, and teamwork.
    *   **Duration:** Play for 5-10 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep your head up," "Change direction quickly," "Have fun!"
