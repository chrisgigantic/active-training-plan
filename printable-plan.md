### Enhanced Youth Training Plan: A Physiologically-Based Approach

| Phase / Athlete Group | Workout Category | Enhanced Exercises & Protocol | Rationale / Key Cues (from Documents) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1: GPP** (General Prep) | **Short Sprints (60m-200m)** | | | **Focus:** Build acceleration mechanics, general strength, and aerobic base on grass/soft surfaces. |
| | **Acceleration Foundation** | • 2x/week: Short Sprints (4-6 x 10-30m) from standing starts.<br>• 1x/week: Resisted Sprints (4-6 x 10-20m with light sled/bands). | Develops the foundation of speed. Resisted sprints improve horizontal force production and teach aggressive pushing mechanics. |
| | **General Endurance/Tempo** | • 1x/week: Extensive Tempo Runs (e.g., 8-10 x 100m @ 65-75% effort with walk-back rest). | Builds aerobic fitness, which aids recovery between high-intensity efforts. Also develops ankle stiffness and running skill at low intensity. |
| | **Strength & Plyometrics** | • 2x/week: Full Body Strength Circuit (Bodyweight/Light DBs): Squats, Lunges, Push-ups, Rows.<br>• **Plyo:** Rudiment Hops, Pogo Hops, Standing Long Jumps. | General strength builds tissue resilience. **Rudiment Hops** are the safest foundational plyometric for ankle strength. **Standing Long Jumps** develop horizontal power. |
| | **Jumps & Sprints (LJ, TJ, HJ)** | | | **Focus:** Develop explosive power, coordination, and foundational sprint speed. |
| | **Accel/Power Foundation** | • 1x/week: Short Sprints (4-6 x 20-30m).<br>• 1x/week: **Bounding Series:** Alternate Leg Bounds, Single Leg Bounds (short distance). | Sprinting is the foundation of all jumps. Bounding is a specific plyometric that directly translates to jumping power and elasticity. |
| | **General Endurance/Tempo** | • 1x/week: Extensive Tempo Runs (e.g., 6-8 x 100m @ 70% effort). | Maintains aerobic fitness and work capacity without the high impact of maximal sprinting/jumping. |
| | **Strength & Plyometrics** | • 2x/week: **Unilateral Strength:** Split Squats, Single Leg RDLs, Step-ups.<br>• **Plyo:** Box Jumps (low box), Standing Triple Jumps. | Unilateral (single-leg) strength is critical for jumping. The **Standing Triple Jump** is an invaluable tool for teaching rhythm and assessing single-leg power. |
| | **Long Sprints (400m)** | | | **Focus:** Build a strong aerobic base and general strength to handle future high-lactate workouts. |
| | **General Endurance/Tempo** | • 1-2x/week: Extensive Tempo Runs (e.g., 8-12 x 200m @ 70-75% effort with 2-3 min rest). | A larger volume of tempo work is needed to build the endurance base required for the 400m. |
| | **Speed Development** | • 1x/week: **Short Hill Sprints** (6-8 x 10-15 seconds) with full walk-down recovery. | Hills are a safe and effective way to build the leg strength and power needed for a fast 400m without the high impact of track work. |
| | **General Strength & Core** | • 2x/week: Full Body Strength Circuit, emphasizing core stability (Planks, Side Planks, Leg Raises). | A strong core is vital for maintaining posture and efficient mechanics during the final, fatiguing stages of the 400m. |
| | **Middle Distance (800m/1500m)** | | | **Focus:** Establish a strong aerobic foundation through consistent running volume. |
| | **Aerobic Base** | • **3-4x per week:** 20-35 min easy runs on varied surfaces (grass/trails).<br>• **1x per week:** Long Run (40-50 min). | Volume is key in GPP for this group. Varied surfaces build resilience. The long run is the most important workout of the week. |
| | **Speed & Running Economy** | • **1x per week:** Short Hill Sprints (8-10 x 10-15 sec) with full recovery.<br>• **2x per week:** Add 4-6 x 100m Strides after easy runs. | Hill sprints build power and improve form. Strides maintain neuromuscular connection to faster running and improve efficiency. |
| | **Strength & Injury Prevention** | • **2x per week:** Bodyweight Circuit with a focus on unilateral exercises (Lunges, Step-ups) and core stability. | Unilateral strength helps prevent imbalances that can arise from high running volume. |
| | **Long Distance (3k/5k)** | | | **Focus:** Maximize aerobic volume and build strength endurance. |
| | **Aerobic Base** | • **4-5x per week:** 30-45 min easy runs.<br>• **1x per week:** Long Run (60-75 min). | The foundation of 5k training is a deep aerobic engine built through consistent volume. |
| | **Strength Endurance & Hills** | • **1x per week:** Run a hilly route for 30-40 min, focusing on consistent effort. | Hilly runs are a form of strength endurance training, building the specific muscular resilience needed for distance racing. |
| | **Running Economy** | • **2x per week:** Add 6-8 x 100m Strides after easy runs. | Improves running mechanics and efficiency, which is crucial for conserving energy over long distances. |
| **P2: SPP** (Specific Prep) | **Short Sprints (60m-200m)** | | | **Focus:** Maximize acceleration and top speed. Transition to track surfaces. |
| | **Acceleration & Max Velocity** | • 1x/week: **Acceleration:** 4-6 x 30-40m from blocks.<br>• 1x/week: **Max Velocity:** 3-5 x 20-30m Flying Sprints with full recovery. | This separates the two key components of a short sprint. Flying Sprints are the primary method for developing top speed. |
| | **Speed Endurance** | • **Micro-dose:** Add 1-2 x 70-90m @ 95% effort after an acceleration day. | Safely introduces the stimulus of running fast under fatigue, preparing the body for the demands of the 100m and 200m. |
| | **Strength & Power** | • 2x/week: **Heavy Lifts:** Squats, Deadlifts (3-5 sets of 3-5 reps).<br>• **Explosive Lifts:** Jump Squats, Med Ball Throws. | Progress to heavier loads to increase maximal force production. Explosive lifts translate that strength into speed. |
| | **Jumps & Sprints (LJ, TJ, HJ)** | | | **Focus:** Convert strength to explosive power and refine event-specific technique at speed. |
| | **Max Velocity & Approach** | • 1x/week: Flying Sprints (3-5 x 30m) to develop approach speed.<br>• 1x/week: **Short Approach Jumps** (3-5 step approach). | Approach speed is the biggest determinant of jump distance. Short approaches allow for technical refinement at high speed. |
| | **Event-Specific Plyos** | • **Depth Jumps (from low box, 6-12 inches)**<br>• **Bounding for distance/height.** | Depth jumps are an intense plyometric for developing reactive strength. Bounding improves horizontal and vertical power. |
| | **Event-Specific Strength** | • 2x/week: **Olympic Lifts** (Power Cleans) and **Unilateral Lifts** (Bulgarian Split Squats). | Olympic lifts develop total-body explosive power. Unilateral lifts build the specific strength needed for single-leg takeoffs. |
| | **Long Sprints (400m)** | | | **Focus:** Develop lactate tolerance and the ability to hold speed under extreme fatigue. |
| | **Speed Endurance** | • 1x/week: **Special Endurance 1:** 2-3 x 200-300m @ 90-95% effort with 15-20 min rest. | The primary workout for a 400m runner. Teaches the body to perform under high levels of metabolic stress. |
| | **Max Velocity Maintenance** | • 1x/week: **Short Speed Endurance:** 3-4 x 150m @ 95%+ effort with 10-15 min rest. | Maintains the raw speed component. A 400m runner must be fast to be great. |
| | **Strength & Power** | • 2x/week: Strength training with a focus on **Strength Endurance** (e.g., higher reps on accessory lifts, circuits with weights). | Builds the muscular endurance needed to maintain powerful strides for the full 400m. |
| | **Middle Distance (800m/1500m)** | | | **Focus:** Sharpening race-specific fitness with a blend of aerobic and anaerobic work. |
| | **Lactate Threshold** | • 1x/week: **Tempo/Cruise Intervals:** 3-5 x 1000m @ tempo pace with 60-90 sec jog rest. | The "secret" workout. This is the single best session for improving the ability to sustain a fast pace in the mile and 800m. |
| | **VO2 Max / Race Pace** | • 1x/week: **Intervals:** 6-8 x 400m @ 1500m race pace OR 4-5 x 600m @ 800m race pace. | Pushes the aerobic ceiling and provides specific practice at race intensity. |
| | **Speed Maintenance** | • **2x per week:** Add 4-6 x 200m cut-downs (getting faster each rep) after easy runs. | Maintains the speed reserve needed for a strong finishing kick. |
| | **Long Distance (3k/5k)** | | | **Focus:** Maximizing aerobic power and lactate threshold. |
| | **Lactate Threshold** | • 1x/week: **Continuous Tempo Run (20-25 min)** OR Long Intervals (e.g., 3-4 x Mile @ tempo pace). | The most important workout for this group. Directly improves the fastest pace they can hold aerobically. |
| | **VO2 Max / Aerobic Power** | • 1x/week: **Intervals:** 4-6 x 800m or 3-5 x 1000m @ 3k-5k race pace with 2-3 min jog recovery. | Improves the body's maximum ability to utilize oxygen, the ultimate limiter in distance events. |
| | **Long Run with Quality** | • 1x/week: Long run (75-90 min) with a "fast finish" for the last 10-15 minutes. | Simulates racing on tired legs, building physical and mental resilience for the latter stages of a 5k. |
| **P3: Competition** | **All Groups** | | | **Focus:** Tapering volume, maintaining intensity, and achieving peak performance ("Supercompensation"). |
| | **Race Simulation/Tune-Up** | • **Short/Long Sprints:** 2-3 x 30-50m @ 98% from blocks.<br>• **Jumps:** 2-3 full approach jumps.<br>• **Mid-D:** 2 x 400m @ goal race pace.<br>• **Long-D:** 2-3 x 800m @ goal race pace. | Very low volume of race-specific work to sharpen the body and mind without causing fatigue. |
| | **CNS Priming/Shakeout** | • **1-2 days before meet:** Abbreviated warm-up, 2-3 very short, explosive efforts (e.g., 20m sprints, a few takeoffs), 2-4 strides. | Wakes up the nervous system to be ready for maximal effort. The goal is to feel "bouncy" and fast. |
| | **Recovery & Mental Prep** | • **Full rest days.**<br>• **Focused Visualization** of the race plan, from warm-up to a successful finish. | Recovery allows for supercompensation. Visualization builds confidence and reduces race-day anxiety. |

## Recovery & Regeneration
*Recovery is as important as the training itself. This section provides guidelines for proper recovery to ensure athletes can adapt to training and prevent injuries.*

### Post-Workout Cool-Down (10-15 mins)
*   **Light Jogging:** 2-3 laps at a very easy pace to flush out metabolic waste.
*   **Static Stretching:** Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds. Focus on major muscle groups: hamstrings, quads, glutes, calves, hip flexors, chest, and shoulders.
*   **Foam Rolling:** Spend 5-10 minutes on tight areas to release muscle tension.

### Nutrition & Hydration
*   **Post-Workout Nutrition:** Consume a snack or meal with a 3:1 or 4:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein within 30-60 minutes after training to replenish glycogen stores and repair muscle tissue.
*   **Hydration:** Drink water throughout the day. Monitor urine color to ensure adequate hydration (should be light yellow).

### Sleep
*   **Aim for 8-10 hours of quality sleep per night.** Sleep is when the body repairs itself and consolidates learning.

---

## Mental Preparation
*Mental skills are crucial for success in athletics. This section provides strategies to help athletes develop mental toughness and prepare for competition.*

### Visualization
*   **Practice visualization for 5-10 minutes daily.** Imagine yourself executing skills perfectly and achieving your goals. This can be done before bed, before practice, or during quiet moments.

### Goal Setting
*   **Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).** This provides direction and motivation for training.
*   **Focus on process goals (e.g., "execute a perfect block start") rather than just outcome goals (e.g., "win the race").**

### Pre-Competition Routine
*   **Develop a consistent pre-competition routine.** This can help reduce anxiety and get you in the right mindset to perform. The routine can include a specific warm-up, visualization, and positive self-talk.
