# Day 2: Speed Endurance/Lactate

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To improve the body's tolerance to lactate build-up, which is the primary limiting factor in longer sprints (200m, 400m). This workout trains athletes to maintain a high speed even when experiencing significant fatigue.

### Drills:

1.  **Interval Sprints Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase the body's capacity to buffer and clear lactic acid while running at a high percentage of max speed. This directly improves performance in the 200m and 400m events.
    *   **Execution:** Athletes run repetitions over distances ranging from 150m to 300m at an intensity of 85% or higher. The recovery between repetitions is typically long (5-8 minutes) to allow for near-full clearance of lactate, ensuring that the quality of each sprint remains high. The focus is on maintaining efficient sprint mechanics despite the growing fatigue.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** A typical session might be 3-4 x 150m, or 2-3 x 250m, depending on the athlete's event and fitness level. The key is high intensity on the run and adequate recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Hold your form together," "Run tall and relaxed, even when it hurts," "Strong arms all the way through the line," "Pace yourself to finish strong."
