# Day 3: Max Velocity Mechanics

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing the ability to run at top speed while staying relaxed, a key component of efficient sprinting.

### Drills:

1.  **Burst and Relax Drill (E1, pg. 6):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build a foundation for relaxed top-speed running.
    *   **Execution:** This drill is run over a 60-meter section of the track, broken into three 20-meter segments.
        *   **First 20m:** Full speed acceleration (the "burst").
        *   **Middle 20m:** Transition to an easy, relaxed, but fast run, focusing on maintaining momentum without straining (the "float" or "relax").
        *   **Final 20m:** Re-accelerate back to full speed.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-6 repetitions with full recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "The middle section is key; stay relaxed," "Feel the difference between straining and floating," "Don't lose your speed in the float."
