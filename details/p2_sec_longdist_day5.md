# Day 5: Long Run with Quality

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To build overall endurance and mental toughness, while also practicing running at a faster pace when already fatigued. This session is a key component of long-distance training, simulating the challenge of finishing a race strong.

### Activity:

1.  **Long Run with Quality Finish:**
    *   **Purpose:** The main portion of the run builds deep aerobic endurance, strengthens muscles and connective tissues, and improves the body's efficiency at using fuel. The "quality" finish at tempo pace teaches the body and mind to push hard on tired legs, a critical skill for racing successfully.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete will perform a long run, typically 50-60 minutes in total. The first 40-50 minutes should be at a slow, easy, conversational pace. For the final 10 minutes of the run, the athlete increases their effort to their tempo pace (the "comfortably hard" pace from Day 2). After the tempo segment is complete, they should cool down with 5-10 minutes of very slow jogging and walking.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous long run.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay relaxed and conserve energy for the first part," "When it's time to pick it up, lock in and focus on that tempo rhythm," "This is where the real work happens; stay strong when you're tired," "Finish the run feeling tired but accomplished, not completely depleted."
