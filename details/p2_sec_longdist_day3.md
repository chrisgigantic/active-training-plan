# Day 3: Aerobic Threshold

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Improving the body's ability to clear lactate by running at a sustained, comfortably hard pace (threshold pace).

### Drills:

1.  **Keep the Pace Drill (Tempo Run) (E1, pg. 22):**
    *   **Purpose:** To help runners learn to maintain an even pace over various intervals, which is a key skill for threshold running.
    *   **Execution:** This drill is best executed as a "tempo run." The goal is to run continuously for 20 minutes at a pace that is "comfortably hard" - you can't hold a full conversation, but you're not gasping for air. This pace corresponds to the aerobic or lactate threshold.
    *   **Alternative (Interval-based):** The coach can set time goals for specific intervals (e.g., every 400m) to help athletes learn the correct pace.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous 20-minute run.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Find a rhythm you can hold," "This should feel strong, not all-out," "Focus on staying relaxed even when it gets uncomfortable."
