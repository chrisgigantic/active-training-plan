# Day 4: Strength & Mobility

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing explosive power for deceleration and building crucial posterior chain strength for a powerful throw.

### Drills:

1.  **Backward Jump & Stick (T1 / T2, pg. 7):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop change of direction skills, core strength, and lower body balance, which are important for controlling the rotational forces of the throw.
    *   **Execution:** Stand on one foot. Take a moderate hop backward and "stick" the landing on the same foot, holding the position for approximately three seconds. Then, hop back to the start using the opposite foot.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 5 reps.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Maintain control by flexing your knee and hip," "Control the core of your body."

2.  **Supermans (for back strength) (T1 / T2, pg. 61):**
    *   **Purpose:** To strengthen the core, particularly the lower back muscles, which are vital for generating power and maintaining posture during the throw.
    *   **Execution:** Lie flat on the ground on your stomach. Lift your arms, chest, and legs up at the same time. Hold for about two seconds, then go back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10-20 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Come down under control," "Squeeze your glutes at the top."
