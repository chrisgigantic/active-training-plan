# Day 3: Full Throw Technique

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Integrating the pivot and the start of the throw to build the full throwing motion.

### Drills:

1.  **Pivoting Drill (No Discus First) (E1, pg. 43):**
    *   **Purpose:** To learn how to pivot quickly and under control.
    *   **Execution:** The thrower stands with their feet shoulder-width apart. On the coach's command, the thrower uses one foot to pivot, spinning around in a full circle three times as quickly as possible. This should be done without a discus initially to focus on balance and speed.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-5 sets of 3 pivots.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Control first, speed second," "Stay balanced," "Feel the rotation through your hips."

2.  **Left Leg Start Drill (E1, pg. 46):**
    *   **Purpose:** To practice a good left leg balance and tuck, which is essential to begin the throw.
    *   **Execution:** The thrower leans slightly to start, with their weight on the right leg and the left arm dangling. The left leg sticks out parallel to the ground to achieve balance. Once balanced, the left leg coils under to the starting position, and the thrower begins their approach to throwing.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 5-10 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Find your balance point," "Feel the stretch," "The throwing elbow should be parallel to the floor."
