# Day 4: Strength & Power

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To develop the power and strength necessary for a strong finishing kick and for maintaining form when fatigued. This session incorporates plyometrics for explosiveness and drills for body control.

### Drills:

1.  **Obstacle Jumps (over cones) (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop reactive strength and power in a controlled manner. Jumping over obstacles improves the stretch-shortening cycle of the leg muscles, leading to a more powerful stride.
    *   **Execution:** Set up a series of 5-8 low cones or hurdles, about 3-4 feet apart. The athlete jumps over them continuously. Variations include:
        *   **Two-Foot Jumps:** Jumping with both feet together.
        *   **Single-Leg Hops:** Hopping over the obstacles on one leg, then switching to the other.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of each variation (two-foot, right leg, left leg).
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Be quick and light off the ground," "Don't spend a lot of time on the floor," "Use your arms to help you jump."

2.  **Linear Run & Stick (T2):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve an athlete's ability to decelerate and control their body, which is crucial for navigating a crowded track and for developing the stability needed for a powerful final kick.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete runs forward at a good pace for 10-15 meters and then, on a signal, comes to a complete stop as quickly as possible, "sticking" the landing on one foot and holding the position for 2-3 seconds without losing balance.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets of 4-5 repetitions, alternating the "stick" leg.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stop on a dime," "Sink your hips to stop," "Stay strong and balanced, don't wobble."
