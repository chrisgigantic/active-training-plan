# Day 5: Active Recovery & Skill 2 (Sprints)

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Reinforcing fundamental sprint mechanics through low-intensity drills to aid recovery and build muscle memory.

### Drills:

1.  **A-March Drill (E1, pg. 14):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop proper hurdling technique and rhythm, which also translates to good sprint posture.
    *   **Execution:** This is a walking drill. March forward, lifting the lead knee high and extending the toe. The action simulates the "climbing" motion over a hurdle. Exaggerate each movement.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 20-30 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "High knees, toes up," "Exaggerate the movement," "Stay tall."

2.  **Step Over Drill (Jogging) (T1 / T2, pg. 36):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop an active, cyclical leg action while in motion.
    *   **Execution:** Perform the "step over" motion (pulling the toe up and stepping over the opposite ankle) while jogging forward. The focus is on maintaining the cyclical action while moving at a light pace.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 20-30 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep the rhythm," "Don't reach with your feet," "Bounce off the ground."

3.  **Drop Skip (T1 / T2, pg. 13):**
    *   **Purpose:** To loosen the hips for more explosive movement.
    *   **Execution:** This drill is performed moving backward. As you take a step backward, bring the opposite knee up and out, then skip. Alternate legs.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 10-20 yards.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Knee up, toe up," "Step down explosively," "Keep your core solid."
