# Day 5: Event-Specific Tech (Sprints)

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To refine the acceleration phase of the sprint, which is the foundation of a successful jump. This session breaks down the start into different distances to ensure a powerful and technically sound drive phase.

### Drills:

1.  **Block Start Intervals (from 3-pt) (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop a consistent and explosive start, focusing on maintaining a powerful body lean and drive through the initial stages of the sprint. Practicing at different distances helps solidify the technique.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete uses a 3-point stance (or blocks if available and proficient). The focus is on a powerful, clean exit.
        *   **10m Starts:** The goal is pure, explosive power. The athlete should focus on pushing hard and staying low for the entire 10 meters.
        *   **20m Starts:** The athlete works on transitioning slightly from the initial drive phase towards a more upright posture, but still maintaining strong acceleration.
        *   **30m Starts:** This distance requires the athlete to begin moving into their max velocity mechanics, smoothly transitioning from the start into a full sprint.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of (1x10m, 1x20m, 1x30m). Full recovery (2-3 minutes) should be taken between each start to ensure maximum quality and power.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Explode out of the blocks," "Keep your head down and drive," "Push, push, push," "Powerful arms, powerful legs."
