# Day 2: Speed Development & Hills

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing raw speed, power, and running-specific strength through hill sprints.

### Drills:

1.  **Short Hill Sprints:**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve running mechanics, build leg strength, and increase power in a way that is less stressful on the joints than flat-ground sprinting.
    *   **Execution:** Find a moderately steep hill. Sprint uphill for 10 to 15 seconds at a near-maximum effort. The focus should be on driving the knees, using a powerful arm swing, and maintaining good posture.
    *   **Recovery:** After each sprint, turn around and walk slowly back down to the starting point. This is your recovery period. Ensure you are fully recovered before starting the next sprint.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 6-8 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Drive your knees up," "Attack the hill," "Use your arms," "Stay tall, don't lean too far forward."
