# Day 2: Running Economy & Hills

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building strength and endurance by running on varied terrain, which improves running economy and mental toughness.

### Drills:

1.  **Cross Country Run Drill (E1, pg. 22):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build endurance and strength while developing a good rhythmic stride over challenging terrain.
    *   **Execution:** The coach sets up a 30 to 45-minute course that has varied terrain, including hills. The route should be marked with different effort levels for different sections (e.g., sprint up a short hill, jog on the flat, maintain a strong rhythmic stride on a long incline).
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous run over the designated course.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Focus on maintaining effort, not pace, on the hills," "Shorten your stride going uphill," "Use the downhills to recover."
