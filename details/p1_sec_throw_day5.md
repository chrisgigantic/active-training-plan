# Day 5: Active Recovery & Coordination

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Promoting recovery while reinforcing the throwing motion and improving flexibility.

### Drills:

1.  **Overhead Basketball Throw (E1, pg. 50):**
    *   **Purpose:** To get throwers into the rhythm of reaching behind them to thrust an object forward, simulating the javelin or shot put motion.
    *   **Execution:** The thrower kneels on a soft surface, with their body fully extended from the knees. They hold a basketball (or soccer/volleyball) overhead, then slowly lean backward as far as they can without falling. The thrower then follows through with their arms to throw the ball forward, aiming for a 45-degree release point.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 8-10 throws.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "This is a good drill to get the feeling of the throw," "Focus on a smooth, powerful motion."

2.  **Stretching:**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve flexibility and range of motion, particularly in the shoulders, chest, and hips, which is crucial for throwers.
    *   **Execution:** Perform a series of static stretches, holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds.
        *   **Chest/Pec Stretch:** In a doorway, place your forearms on the frame and gently step forward.
        *   **Shoulder/Triceps Stretch:** Bring one arm across your body and gently pull it with the other. Then, bring the arm overhead and pull the elbow with the opposite hand.
        *   **Lat Stretch:** Reach overhead and to the side.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 1-2 sets of each stretch.
