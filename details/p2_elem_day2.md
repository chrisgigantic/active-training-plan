# Day 2: General Endurance

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building a basic level of endurance in a fun and engaging way. This helps with recovery between sprints and builds overall fitness.

### Drills:

1.  **Keep the Pace Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop a sense of pace and improve aerobic capacity.
    *   **Execution:** This is best framed as a game. The coach blows a whistle, and the athletes have to run from one side of a field to the other (e.g., 50-60 meters) before the next whistle blows. The interval between whistles should be consistent (e.g., every 20 seconds).
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Run for a set duration, for example, 2 sets of 5 minutes with a 3-minute rest in between.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Run smooth and relaxed," "Don't start too fast," "Listen for the whistle!"

2.  **Whistle Game on a Field:**
    *   **Purpose:** A variation of the above that is less structured and more reactive.
    *   **Execution:** Athletes jog around a field. When the coach blows the whistle once, they have to sprint for 30 meters. When the coach blows the whistle twice, they have to jog back to the starting point.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Continue for 8-10 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Always be ready," "Listen carefully," "Have fun with it."
