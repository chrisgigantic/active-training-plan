# Day 1: Acceleration Foundation

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing explosive starting strength and acceleration mechanics.

### Drills:

1.  **Falling Runs (T1 / T2, pg. 35):**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach a natural forward lean and an explosive start.
    *   **Execution:** Stand tall with good posture. Allow your body to fall forward, maintaining a straight line from head to ankles. Just before you lose balance, drive your legs out and explode into a 10-20 yard sprint.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 repetitions with full recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Let gravity initiate the sprint," "Push the ground away," "Stay low and drive."

2.  **Let Go's (Partner Resisted) (T1 / T2, pg. 40):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build acceleration and speed against resistance.
    *   **Execution:** A partner stands behind the sprinter, holding a belt securely fastened around the sprinter's waist. The sprinter leans forward, and the partner holds them back for 3-4 steps as they begin to sprint. The partner then lets go, and the sprinter explodes forward for another 10-15 yards.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-5 repetitions per sprinter.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Focus on good running technique even with resistance," "Drive your knees," "Explode when released."
