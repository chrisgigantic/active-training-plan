# Day 1: Acceleration & Power

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To maximize explosive power out of the start and to build the specific strength required to overcome inertia and accelerate effectively.

### Drills:

1.  **Block Start Intervals (3-pt) (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop a consistent and powerful start, focusing on the application of force into the blocks (or ground) and maintaining an efficient drive phase.
    *   **Execution:** From a 3-point stance or starting blocks, the athlete practices starts over short distances (10m, 20m, 30m). The emphasis is on a powerful push from both legs, a low body angle, and aggressive arm action to drive the body forward.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-6 starts, varying the distance. Full recovery (2-3 minutes) between each repetition is essential for maintaining high quality.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Push, don't just step out," "Drive the back leg forward," "Keep your head in a neutral position, looking at the ground in front of you."

2.  **Partner Resisted Runs (T2):**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase acceleration-specific strength by adding light resistance. This forces the athlete to apply more force to the ground to move forward, improving their power in the drive phase.
    *   **Execution:** One athlete (the sprinter) wears a belt or harness. Their partner stands behind them, holding a towel or band attached to the harness. The sprinter drives forward for 15-20 meters while the partner provides light, consistent resistance. The resistance should be enough to make the sprinter work harder, but not so much that it significantly alters their sprint mechanics.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 repetitions per partner, with full recovery in between.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Drive your knees forward," "Maintain a forward lean against the resistance," "Keep your arm swing aggressive."
