# Day 4: Intro to Plyos/Power

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To introduce basic plyometric exercises that develop explosive power, which is essential for sprinting. The session also focuses on improving foot speed and coordination.

### Drills:

1.  **Standing Long Jumps:**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop horizontal explosive power from a stationary position. This directly translates to the power needed for the initial push in a sprint start.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete stands with feet shoulder-width apart. They swing their arms back while bending their knees and hips into a squat position. Without pausing, they swing their arms forward explosively and jump as far forward as possible, landing on two feet and sticking the landing without falling.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of 5 jumps. Focus on maximal effort for each jump with a walk-back recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Swing your arms to fly," "Explode out, not up," "Land soft like a cat."

2.  **Line Drills (Lateral & F/B) (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve foot speed, agility, and coordination. These quick-foot drills train the nervous system to fire rapidly, which is crucial for a fast stride rate.
    *   **Execution:** Find a line on the ground.
        *   **Lateral:** Stand beside the line and hop side-to-side over it as quickly as possible, first with two feet, then on the right foot only, then on the left foot only.
        *   **Forward/Backward (F/B):** Face the line and hop forward and backward over it, again with two feet, then right foot only, then left foot only.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform each variation (lateral two-foot, lateral right, lateral left, F/B two-foot, F/B right, F/B left) for 15-20 seconds.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Quick feet, light feet," "Stay on the balls of your feet," "Don't touch the line."
