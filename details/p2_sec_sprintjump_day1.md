# Day 1: Acceleration & Power Foundation

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing the fundamental explosive power and acceleration mechanics required for both sprinting and jumping events.

### Drills:

1.  **Falling Runs (T1 / T2, pg. 35):**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach a natural forward lean and explosive start.
    *   **Execution:** Stand tall with good posture. Allow your body to fall forward, keeping a straight line from head to ankles. Just before you lose balance, drive your legs out and explode into a 10-20 yard sprint.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 repetitions with full recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Let gravity do the work," "Push the ground away from you," "Stay low in the first few steps."

2.  **Bounding (T1 / T2, pg. 38):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop explosive power and improve stride length and hip drive.
    *   **Execution:** This is an exaggerated running motion. Drive the knee up forcefully and extend the stride, aiming for maximum distance on each "bound." Land on the opposite foot and immediately explode into the next bound.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets over 20-30 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Drive your knees high," "Powerful arm swing," "Explode off the ground."

3.  **Tuck Jumps (Low Volume) (T1 / T2, pg. 38):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop vertical explosive power and fast muscle contraction.
    *   **Execution:** Jump forward off of two feet, trying to bring the knees up as high as the hips. On each jump, bend your knees and use your arms to explode up as high as you can.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of 5-8 jumps. Keep the volume low initially to avoid excessive impact.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Knees to chest," "Explode up," "Land softly."
