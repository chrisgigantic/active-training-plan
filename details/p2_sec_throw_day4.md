# Day 4: Max Strength & Core

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To develop maximum unilateral (single-leg) strength and the rotational core power that is essential for transferring force from the ground, through the body, and into the implement.

### Drills:

1.  **One-leg Jumps (T2):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build explosive power and stability in each leg individually. This is critical for the blocking action of the non-throwing side and the driving force of the throwing side leg.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete stands on one leg and performs a series of maximal-effort jumps for distance or height. This can be done as single hops in place, or as a series of hops forward over a set distance (e.g., 10-15 meters).
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of 5-6 jumps per leg.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Explode off the ground with each jump," "Land stable and controlled before the next jump," "Use your arms to help you generate power."

2.  **Core Rotation (no ball) (T2):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop the high-speed rotational strength and endurance in the core (obliques, abs, lower back) that is central to all throwing events.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete lies on their back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. They bring their knees up towards their chest and then rotate them from side to side, trying to touch their knees to the ground on each side while keeping their shoulders flat on the ground. For a more advanced version, they can extend their legs straight up and rotate them side to side.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10-15 rotations to each side.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Control the movement, don't just swing your legs," "Keep your shoulders pinned to the floor," "Feel the stretch and contraction in your sides."
