# Day 5: Active Recovery & Skill Review

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Light activity to promote recovery while reinforcing coordination and athletic skills in a fun, low-stress environment.

### Drills:

1.  **Line Drills (T1 / T2, pg. 22):**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase foot speed, quickness, and coordination.
    *   **Execution:** Find a line on the track or field. Perform a series of jumps over the line.
        *   **Lateral Jumps:** Jump side-to-side over the line with two feet, then with one foot.
        *   **Forward/Backward Jumps:** Face the line and jump forward and back over it with two feet, then with one foot.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each variation.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Pop off the ground," "Quick feet," "Don't stab your toes into the ground."

2.  **Carioca (T2, pg. 12):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve body control, balance, and hip mobility.
    *   **Execution:** Move laterally (to the right, for example). Step behind with the left foot, shuffle laterally with the right foot, then bring the left foot up and across in an explosive crossover step. Repeat the sequence.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform for 10-20 yards, then switch directions. Do 2-3 sets in each direction.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep your hips moving," "Stay light on your feet," "Exaggerate the crossover step."

3.  **Skill-Based Tag Game:**
    *   **Purpose:** To apply athletic movements in a fun, reactive, and competitive setting.
    *   **Execution (Example: "Freeze Tag"):** A classic game of tag. When a player is tagged, they must "freeze" in an athletic position (e.g., a lunge, a single-leg balance). Other players can "unfreeze" them by crawling under their legs or performing another designated action. This encourages agility, changes of direction, and teamwork.
    *   **Duration:** Play for 5-10 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep your head up," "Change direction quickly," "Have fun!"
