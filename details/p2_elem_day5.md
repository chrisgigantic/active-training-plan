# Day 5: Pre-Meet Simulation

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To introduce young athletes to the structure and feel of a competition in a fun, low-stress environment. This helps them understand the process of warming up, competing, and waiting for their turn, reducing anxiety for actual meets.

### Drills / Activity:

1.  **Mock Meet on Field:**
    *   **Purpose:** To simulate a real track meet, allowing athletes to practice their skills under timed or measured conditions. It helps them apply what they've learned during the week and builds confidence.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Warm-up:** Begin with a standard group warm-up as if it were a real meet day.
        *   **Event 1: 40m Dash:** Organize the athletes into heats. Use a whistle or a loud "Go!" command for the start. Time each athlete's sprint. This is a chance to practice the 3-point starts and acceleration they've been working on.
        *   **Event 2: Standing Long Jump (SLJ):** Set up a measuring tape in a safe area (like a long jump pit or a grassy field). Each athlete gets 2-3 attempts to jump as far as they can from a two-footed start. This reinforces the power development from the plyometric day.
        *   **Cool-down:** Finish with a group cool-down and stretching session.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Each athlete performs 1-2 timed 40m dashes and 2-3 measured standing long jumps.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Remember what we practiced in the starts," "Use your arms to jump farther," "Cheer for your teammates," "Most importantly, have fun!"
