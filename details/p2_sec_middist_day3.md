# Day 3: Lactate Tolerance

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To improve the body's ability to tolerate and perform under high levels of lactic acid. This type of training is mentally and physically tough and is critical for developing a strong finishing kick in the 800m and 1500m.

### Drills:

1.  **Same Time Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To challenge the anaerobic system by forcing the athlete to run progressively longer distances in the same amount of time. This requires a significant increase in speed and power output with each repetition, building immense lactate tolerance.
    *   **Execution:** Mark off distances of 40m, 50m, and 60m. The coach sets a challenging but achievable time (e.g., 7 seconds).
        *   First, the athlete sprints 40m, aiming to meet the target time. They then have a walk-back recovery.
        *   Next, they sprint 50m, aiming for the *same* target time. This requires a faster average speed. Walk-back recovery.
        *   Finally, they sprint 60m, again aiming for the *same* target time, requiring their fastest speed yet.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 full sets (40m, 50m, 60m) with full recovery (4-5 minutes) between each set.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Explode on the first run," "You have to be faster on the second, drive your arms," "Last one is all out, give it everything you have!"
