# Day 1: Aerobic Base

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building a strong and durable aerobic foundation, which is the most critical element for long-distance success.

### Drills:

1.  **Easy Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase cardiovascular fitness, improve the body's ability to use oxygen, and build endurance for longer events.
    *   **Execution:** Run for 25 to 35 minutes at a comfortable, conversational pace. The effort should be easy enough that you could chat with a training partner. The run can be done on varied terrain like roads, trails, or grass fields.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous run.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay relaxed and smooth," "This is about building your engine," "Listen to your body and don't push the pace."
