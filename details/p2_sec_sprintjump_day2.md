# Day 2: Speed Endurance

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To build the capacity to maintain a high percentage of maximum speed over longer distances. This is vital for jumpers who need to perform multiple high-quality sprints and jumps during a competition without a significant drop-off in performance.

### Drills:

1.  **Interval Sprints Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve the body's ability to handle and clear lactate, which is a byproduct of high-intensity exercise. This allows athletes to hold their speed for longer and recover more quickly between efforts.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete runs a set distance (e.g., 200 meters) at a specific intensity (e.g., 85% of maximum effort). This should feel "fast but controlled." After the sprint, they take a specific rest interval (e.g., 3-4 minutes of walking/light jogging) before starting the next repetition. The quality of the run is more important than the rest time, so recovery should be sufficient to maintain the target pace.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 repetitions of 200m sprints at 85% effort, with 3-4 minutes of active recovery between each.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Find a strong, steady rhythm," "Focus on smooth, efficient form," "Don't strain; run relaxed and fast," "The last rep should be as good as the first."
