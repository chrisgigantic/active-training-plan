# Day 2: Event-Specific Power

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To translate foundational strength into event-specific throwing power. This session focuses on the mechanics of the release and achieving the optimal trajectory for the implement.

### Drills:

1.  **Standing Javelin Throw (E1) (use stick):**
    *   **Purpose:** To practice the correct sequence of the throwing motion from a static position, focusing on the powerful hip turn and arm strike. Using a light stick allows for many repetitions without excessive fatigue.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete stands with their non-throwing side foot forward. Holding a stick with a javelin grip, they extend the stick straight back. The throwing motion is initiated by turning the hips and torso aggressively towards the front, followed by the arm striking forward and releasing the stick.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets of 8-10 throws.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Hips first, then arm," "Keep the stick's tip close to your eyebrow," "Throw through the point."

2.  **Obstacle Release Drill (E1) (use cone):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop a consistent and optimal release angle for the shot put. Throwing over an obstacle forces the athlete to achieve the necessary height on the implement for maximum distance.
    *   **Execution:** Place a cone or other low obstacle about 10-15 feet in front of the thrower. From a standing throw position, the athlete executes a throw, focusing on releasing the shot put at an angle that allows it to travel up and over the obstacle. The ideal trajectory is around 40-45 degrees.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets of 5-6 throws.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Push the shot up and out," "Get it over the cone," "Extend fully through your fingers at release."
