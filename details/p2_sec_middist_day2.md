# Day 2: Race Pace / VO2 Max

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To improve the body's maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 Max) and to simulate the changing paces and efforts of a middle-distance race. This is a high-intensity workout designed to significantly boost race-specific fitness.

### Drills:

1.  **3 Event Running Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach athletes how to manage different phases of a 400m or 800m race: the initial aggressive start, the strong and steady mid-race stride, and the all-out finishing kick.
    *   **Execution:** This drill is typically done over 400 meters and broken into three distinct parts:
        *   **Part 1 (First 50-100m):** The athlete sprints out hard, simulating the start of a race to get into a good position.
        *   **Part 2 (Middle 200m):** The athlete settles into a strong, rhythmic, but relaxed stride at or near their goal race pace.
        *   **Part 3 (Final 100m):** The athlete begins their finishing kick, accelerating and running as hard as they can through the finish line.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions with long recovery periods (6-8 minutes) to allow the body to be ready for another high-quality effort.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Get out hard in the first 100," "Settle into your race rhythm in the middle," "Drive your arms and legs to accelerate in the final 100," "Finish strong through the line."
