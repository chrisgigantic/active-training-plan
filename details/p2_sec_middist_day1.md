# Day 1: Aerobic Support

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To maintain and support the aerobic base built in the previous phase. This steady-state run is crucial for endurance, recovery between harder workouts, and overall cardiovascular health, which is the foundation for middle-distance performance.

### Activity:

1.  **Moderate Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a cardiovascular stimulus that maintains aerobic fitness without causing significant fatigue. This type of run supports the higher intensity workouts planned for other days of the week.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete runs for 25-30 minutes at a steady, comfortable, and conversational pace. The effort should be consistent, allowing them to hold a rhythm without straining. This can be done on a track, field, or a safe road/trail route.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous run of 25-30 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Find a smooth and easy rhythm," "Your breathing should be controlled, not labored," "Focus on good posture: run tall," "This is about time on your feet, not speed."
