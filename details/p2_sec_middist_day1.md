# Day 1: Aerobic Base

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building a solid aerobic foundation, which is the cornerstone of all middle-distance running.

### Drills:

1.  **Easy Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase cardiovascular fitness, improve endurance, and build capillary density in the muscles without putting too much stress on the body.
    *   **Execution:** Run for 20 to 30 minutes at a comfortable, conversational pace. This means you should be able to hold a conversation with a training partner without gasping for breath. The run can be done on a track, a grass field, or a road.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous run.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep it easy and relaxed," "The goal is time on your feet, not speed," "Listen to your body."
