# Day 4: General Strength & Mobility

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Improving full-body strength, balance, and mobility to support a strong running posture and prevent injuries.

### Drills:

1.  **Bodyweight Circuit:**
    *   **Purpose:** To build functional strength in the major muscle groups used for running.
    *   **Execution:** Perform a circuit of bodyweight exercises such as Squats, Lunges, Push-ups, and Planks.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 rounds of the circuit. For each exercise, perform 10-15 reps or hold for 30-60 seconds.

2.  **Balance Pick Up Game (T2, pg. 10):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop single-leg balance, strength, and control.
    *   **Execution:** This is essentially a single-leg squat. Stand on one leg. Bend down on that leg to pick up a small object (like a cone or a baseball) from the ground, then return to a full standing position. Then, go back down to set the object back on the ground.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 5-10 reps on each leg.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Go up and down slowly and with control," "Keep your back foot in the air," "Keep your core solid."
