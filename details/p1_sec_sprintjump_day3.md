# Day 3: Technical Skill 1 (Approach)

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing the specific rhythm and posture for the jump approach.

### Drills:

1.  **Rhythm High Knees Drill (E1, pg. 30):**
    *   **Purpose:** To learn and practice a rhythmic, high-knee stride for the jump approach.
    *   **Execution:** The jumper measures their approach and then practices it using a high-knee, rhythmic stride towards the scratchboard. The stride should start slower with higher knees and then the rhythm and speed should increase as the jumper gets closer to the board.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform 5-10 full approaches.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Feel the rhythm," "Knees up, toes up," "Accelerate into the board."

2.  **Approach & Thrust Drill (E1, pg. 34):**
    *   **Purpose:** To work specifically on the approach without the complexity of the full jump.
    *   **Execution:** The jumper performs their full, measured approach. Once they have gone through the hop and step phases of the triple jump, instead of executing the final jump, they perform a firm upward "thrust" to simulate the final takeoff.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 5-8 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "A consistent approach leads to consistent jumps," "Stay tall on the final thrust," "Don't actually jump, just practice the motion."
