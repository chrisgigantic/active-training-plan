# Day 1: Acceleration Development

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To build on the acceleration foundation by introducing more dynamic starting positions and increasing the intensity of sprints, preparing athletes for more competitive efforts.

### Drills:

1.  **3-Point Starts to 20m:**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve explosive acceleration from a static start, focusing on maintaining a low body angle and powerful leg drive over the initial 20 meters.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete assumes a 3-point stance with one hand down on the starting line and feet staggered. On the "set" command, hips rise slightly above the shoulders. On "go," the athlete drives out explosively, focusing on pushing powerfully for the full 20 meters while keeping a low head and body angle for the first few steps.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 5-6 repetitions with full recovery (2-3 minutes) between each start.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Push the ground away," "Stay low and drive," "Powerful arms, powerful legs."

2.  **Get Ups (from push-up pos.) (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop total-body explosive power and the ability to transition quickly from the ground to a full sprint. This builds crucial starting strength.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete begins in a standard push-up position. On command, they explosively push off the ground, bringing their feet underneath their hips to land in a low crouch, and immediately sprint forward for 10-15 meters.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 repetitions with full recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Explode up and forward," "Get your feet under you fast," "Drive out, not up."
