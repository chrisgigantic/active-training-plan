### Activity:

1.  **Competition Day Protocol:**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a structured approach to competition day that maximizes performance and minimizes stress.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Pre-Meet:** Ensure proper nutrition and hydration in the hours leading up to the meet. Arrive at the venue with plenty of time.
        *   **Warm-up:** Begin the general warm-up (jogging, dynamic drills) approximately 45-60 minutes before the event is scheduled to start.
        *   **Specific Warm-up:** About 20-25 minutes before the event, perform event-specific movements. For sprinters, this means a few practice starts. For jumpers, a few run-throughs. For throwers, a few easy throws. For distance runners, a few strides at race pace.
        *   **Compete:** Focus on the race or event plan. Execute the technique and effort rehearsed in training.
        *   **Cool-down:** After the event is completely finished, perform a 10-15 minute cool-down with light jogging and static stretching to aid recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Trust your training," "Focus on your own race/throw/jump," "Execute your plan," "Support your teammates," "Win or lose, give your best effort."
