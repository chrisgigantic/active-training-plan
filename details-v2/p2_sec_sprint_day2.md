# Day 2: General Endurance & Tempo

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building a strong aerobic base and the ability to maintain form over longer distances at a controlled tempo.

### Drills:

1.  **Speed Endurance Drill (Tempo Runs) (E1, pg. 7):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve aerobic conditioning and the ability to hold a relaxed pace, which is crucial for recovery and overall capacity.
    *   **Execution:** This session involves running multiple, longer intervals at a controlled, conversational pace. The runs should be done on a soft surface like a grass field if possible.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 8 to 10 repetitions of 150-meter runs at approximately 65-70% of maximum speed. The recovery should be a slow walk back to the start.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "This is about rhythm, not speed," "Stay smooth and relaxed," "Focus on efficient, easy running form."
