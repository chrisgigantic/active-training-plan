# Day 1: Acceleration Foundation

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building the fundamental patterns of acceleration. The goal is to teach the body to push horizontally and drive forward effectively.

### Drills:

1.  **Falling Runs (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach the natural feeling of leaning into acceleration.
    *   **Execution:** Stand tall, feet together. Let your body fall forward, keeping a straight line from head to heels. When you feel you're about to lose balance, drive your legs out to "catch" yourself and sprint for 10-15 meters.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Don't bend at the waist," "Let gravity pull you," "Push the ground away behind you."

2.  **3-Point Starts (No Blocks):**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduce a more powerful starting position without the complexity of blocks.
    *   **Execution:** One hand down on the start line, feet staggered. The front foot should be about a foot behind the line, and the back knee is on the ground. On "set," lift the hips higher than the shoulders. On "go," drive out explosively.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 5-6 starts over 10-20 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Push with both feet," "Keep your head down for the first few steps," "Low and powerful."

3.  **10-20m Sprints:**
    *   **Purpose:** To practice the full acceleration pattern at maximum effort.
    *   **Execution:** After the 3-point start, continue sprinting at 95-100% effort for the full distance.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 sprints with full recovery (2-3 minutes) between each.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Every step should be powerful," "Drive your arms," "Stay relaxed."
