# Day 2: Full Recovery

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To ensure young athletes are fully rested and recovered. Growth and adaptation happen during rest, and it's especially important for younger athletes to avoid overtraining.

### Activity:

1.  **Off Day or Light Walk:**
    *   **Purpose:** To allow the body and mind to completely recover before the next activity. This helps prevent burnout and keeps the sport fun.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Option A (Off Day):** No structured practice. Encourage light, fun activities like playing at a park.
        *   **Option B (Light Walk):** A 10-15 minute walk with family or friends. The goal is gentle movement, not exercise.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** N/A
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Today is for rest and fun," "Let your body get stronger by resting," "We'll be ready to go next time!"
