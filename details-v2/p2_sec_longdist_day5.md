# Day 5: Long Run Foundation

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building endurance, mental toughness, and the physiological adaptations necessary for long-distance running.

### Drills:

1.  **Long, Slow Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the most important workout of the week for a distance runner. It builds mitochondria, increases blood volume, strengthens slow-twitch muscle fibers, and teaches the body to be more efficient at using fat for fuel.
    *   **Execution:** Run for 40 to 50 minutes at a slow, comfortable, and conversational pace. The effort should be very easy.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous run.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "The pace should be very relaxed," "This is about time on your feet, not speed," "Enjoy the run."
