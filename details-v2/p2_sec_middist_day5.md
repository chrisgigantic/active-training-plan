# Day 5: Active Recovery & Strides

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To facilitate recovery from the week's harder sessions while maintaining a feel for faster, more efficient running mechanics. This session is light and designed to help the body adapt and prepare for the next training block.

### Activity:

1.  **Easy Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase blood flow, aid in the removal of metabolic byproducts, and promote muscle repair without adding significant training stress.
    *   **Execution:** A 15-20 minute run at a very low intensity. The pace should be easy and conversational, allowing the body to recover.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous 15-20 minute run.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep it relaxed and comfortable," "Just shake out the legs," "Listen to your body."

2.  **Strides on Field:**
    *   **Purpose:** To touch upon faster running and reinforce good mechanics without being a taxing workout. Strides help maintain neuromuscular coordination for speed and efficiency.
    *   **Execution:** After the easy run, the athlete performs 4-6 strides over 80-100 meters on a flat, grassy field. A stride is a gradual acceleration to about 85-90% of maximum speed, holding that for a short period, and then gradually decelerating. The focus is on feeling smooth, fast, and relaxed.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 4-6 repetitions of 80-100m strides with a full walk-back recovery between each.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Run tall and smooth," "Let the speed come to you, don't force it," "Feel light on your feet."
