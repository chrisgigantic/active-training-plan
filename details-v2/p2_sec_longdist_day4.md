# Day 4: Active Recovery & Drills

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To allow the body to recover and adapt from the high-intensity workouts of the previous days. Active recovery is crucial for preventing overtraining and injury, ensuring the athlete is ready for the upcoming long run.

### Activity:

1.  **Very Easy Run or Cross-Train:**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote blood flow and aid recovery without adding any significant training stress. Cross-training (like swimming or cycling) can provide a mental break and work different muscles while still offering an aerobic benefit.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Option A (Easy Run):** A 20-25 minute run at a very slow, relaxed, and easy pace. The effort should be minimal.
        *   **Option B (Cross-Train):** 20-30 minutes of a low-impact activity like stationary biking, swimming, or using an elliptical. The intensity should remain low and conversational.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous 20-30 minute session.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Today is about recovery, not fitness," "Keep the effort very light," "Listen to your body and give it a chance to heal."
