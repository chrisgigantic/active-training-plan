# Day 1: Max Velocity & Power

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To develop maximum velocity for the sprint approach and to build reactive power, which is critical for converting horizontal speed into vertical and horizontal distance in jumps.

### Drills:

1.  **Increase Acceleration Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To train the nervous system and muscles to accelerate in the later stages of a sprint, fighting the natural tendency to decelerate. This is crucial for maintaining speed through the takeoff board.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete sprints for 100 meters. The first 50 meters are run at a strong, but sub-maximal pace (around 90%). At the 50-meter mark, the athlete consciously increases their effort and acceleration, aiming to achieve maximum velocity in the final 50 meters.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 repetitions with full recovery (4-5 minutes) to ensure each rep is high quality.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Build speed to the 50," "At the 50, switch gears and drive," "Finish faster than you started," "Stay tall and powerful."

2.  **Box Drops (on ledge/bench) (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop reactive strength and the stretch-shortening cycle. This drill teaches the muscles to absorb force upon landing and immediately redirect it into an explosive upward movement, mimicking the takeoff in a jump.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete stands on a sturdy box or bench (12-20 inches high). They step off (do not jump off) the edge, landing on two feet on the ground. The moment their feet touch the ground, they should explode into a maximal vertical jump. The key is to minimize ground contact time.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of 5-6 drops.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Step off, don't jump," "Spend as little time on the ground as possible," "Explode up immediately," "Land soft on the box, jump high off the ground."
