# Day 3: Event-Specific Tech (Jumps)

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To dedicate practice time to the highly technical aspects of either the Long Jump or Triple Jump. This allows for concentrated effort on the specific mechanics that lead to greater distances.

### Drills:

**Option 1: Long Jump (LJ) Day**

1.  **Heel Pops Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To perfect the penultimate (second to last) step and the transition to the takeoff foot, which is crucial for converting horizontal velocity into vertical lift.
    *   **Execution:** From a short, 4-6 step approach, the athlete focuses on the final two steps. The second-to-last step should be slightly longer, with the foot planting flat. The final step (takeoff foot) lands heel-first and then rocks forward to the toe in a "popping" motion, driving the hips up and forward. The drill ends with the takeoff, not a full jump into the pit.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets of 5-6 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Step flat, then pop off the heel," "Roll from heel to toe," "Drive the free knee up high."

2.  **In-Flight Cycle Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach the "running in the air" or "hitch-kick" technique, which helps counteract forward rotation and allows the jumper to hold their landing position longer for extra distance.
    *   **Execution:** Using a very short approach (3-5 steps) and taking off from the ground or a low box, the athlete jumps into the sandpit. While in the air, they perform a single cycling motion with their legs, as if taking another running stride, before extending both legs forward for the landing.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets of 4-5 jumps.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Take off and keep running in the air," "Cycle the legs through," "Get your feet out in front of you to land."

**Option 2: Triple Jump (TJ) Day**

1.  **Multiple Cone Hops (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop the rhythm, power, and coordination required for the hop and step phases of the triple jump.
    *   **Execution:** Place a series of 5-6 low cones or markers in a line, spaced about 4-6 feet apart. From a short approach, the athlete takes off and performs continuous single-leg hops over the cones, focusing on maintaining balance and forward momentum. The drill can be done as hop-hop-hop or hop-step-hop to simulate different phases.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets, going through the cone sequence.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay tall and bouncy," "Drive your knee up with each hop," "Keep your arms active and coordinated with your legs."
