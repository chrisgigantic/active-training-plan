# Day 3: CNS Priming/Sharpening

**Group:** All Groups (Secondary)
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To "wake up" the Central Nervous System (CNS) with very short, high-intensity bursts of activity. This session primes the neuromuscular connections for explosive effort, ensuring the athlete feels sharp, fast, and ready to compete without causing any fatigue.

### Activities:

1.  **Abbreviated Warm-up:**
    *   **Purpose:** To prepare the body for the priming activity without expending unnecessary energy.
    *   **Execution:** A very short version of the standard warm-up, lasting about 10-12 minutes. This might include a few minutes of light jogging, some dynamic mobility drills (leg swings, arm circles), and a couple of key activation drills (A-skips, high knees).
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Just get the body moving and warm," "Short and sharp."

2.  **Short, Fast Efforts:**
    *   **Purpose:** To activate the fast-twitch muscle fibers and prime the CNS for a high level of performance.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete performs 2-3 repetitions of a very short, explosive, event-specific movement at 95-100% intensity.
        *   **Sprints/Jumps:** 2-3 x 20m sprints from a 3-point start, or 2-3 takeoffs at the board into the pit.
        *   **Mid/Long-Distance:** 2-3 x 100m strides at goal race pace or slightly faster.
        *   **Throwers:** 2-3 standing throws or half-turns focusing on speed and explosive finish.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Only 2-3 repetitions with full recovery between each. The entire session after warm-up should be very brief (5-10 minutes).
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Feel fast and explosive," "This is about speed, not endurance," "Sharp and quick."
