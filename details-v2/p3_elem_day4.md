# Day 4: Pre-Meet Shakeout

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To keep the session very light and fun, helping the athletes stay loose and mentally prepared. Reviewing the rules helps reduce any anxiety about the upcoming competition day.

### Activities:

1.  **Light Jog & Drills:**
    *   **Purpose:** To do some light movement to stay loose without causing any fatigue.
    *   **Execution:** A 5-minute light jog, followed by a few favorite low-intensity drills like A-skips or carioca. The entire warm-up should be no more than 10-15 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Nice and easy today," "Let's just have some fun."

2.  **Review "Meet" Rules:**
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure the athletes understand the basics of the competition, such as where to check in, when to start their warm-up, and what the commands for the start of the race will be.
    *   **Execution:** After the light warm-up, gather the athletes and walk them through the schedule for the next day. Explain the starting commands ("on your marks," "set," "go") and practice them a couple of times from a standing start.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Tomorrow is all about having fun and trying your best," "Listen for the commands just like we practiced," "The most important rule is to cheer for everyone."
