# Day 3: Max Velocity Mechanics

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Introducing the basic mechanics required for running at top speed. The emphasis is on posture and efficient leg action.

### Drills:

1.  **Step Over Drill (Walking) (T1 / T2, pg. 36):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop an active, cyclical leg action.
    *   **Execution:** This is performed at a walking pace. As you step forward, focus on pulling the toe up towards the shin and "stepping over" the opposite ankle. The foot should be moving backward as it strikes the ground. The focus is on creating a smooth, rolling motion.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 20-30 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Step over the opposite knee," "Keep your toes up," "Feel the foot pulling back under you."

2.  **Quick Skips (Linear) (T1 / T2, pg. 21):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop quick muscle response and a fast, reactive ground contact.
    *   **Execution:** Perform a standard skipping motion, but focus on taking short, sharp steps. Pop off the front of the foot as quickly as possible. This is a linear skip, moving straight forward.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 10-20 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Be light on your feet," "Pop off the ground," "Quick, quick, quick!"

3.  **"Running Tall" Cues:**
    *   **Purpose:** To establish a strong, upright posture which is essential for maximum velocity.
    *   **Execution:** During light jogs or strides, athletes should focus on running as if a string is pulling the top of their head towards the sky. Hips should be forward ("up"), and there should be no bending at the waist.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Run tall," "Hips to the sky," "Don't sit in the bucket."
