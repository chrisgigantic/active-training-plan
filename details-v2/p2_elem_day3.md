# Day 3: Max Velocity Application

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To teach athletes how to run relaxed at near-maximum speeds. This drill helps them understand the difference between straining for speed and achieving it through efficient, fluid mechanics.

### Drills:

1.  **Burst and Relax Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop the ability to maintain speed without tension. The "float" or "relax" phase teaches the body that it can maintain velocity without maximal effort, which is key to preventing premature fatigue in a race.
    *   **Execution:** Mark off three consecutive 15-meter zones. The athlete starts from a jog or a 3-point start and accelerates ("bursts") through the first 15m zone. Upon entering the second 15m zone, they consciously relax their face, shoulders, and arms, focusing on "floating" or maintaining momentum rather than actively pushing. In the final 15m zone, they re-accelerate ("burst") again to the finish line.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 repetitions with full recovery (3-4 minutes) between each.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Fast and powerful for the first burst," "In the middle, 'float' and be smooth," "For the last part, turn the speed back on," "Relax your jaw and shoulders."
