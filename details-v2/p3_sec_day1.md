# Day 1: Race Simulation/Tune-Up

**Group:** All Groups (Secondary)
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To perform a high-quality, event-specific tune-up that simulates the intensity of a competition without inducing excessive fatigue. This session sharpens the athlete's skills and builds confidence ahead of the meet.

### Drills / Activities:

1.  **Sprints (for Sprinters & Jumpers):**
    *   **Purpose:** To rehearse the start and initial acceleration at near-race intensity.
    *   **Execution:** 2-3 repetitions of 40m sprints from a 3-point start or blocks at 95% effort. Full recovery (4-5 minutes) is taken between each to ensure maximal quality.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Be explosive and clean out of the blocks," "Execute your race plan for the first 40 meters."

2.  **Jumps (for Jumpers):**
    *   **Purpose:** To groove the rhythm and timing of the full approach without the physical stress of a full jump.
    *   **Execution:** 3-4 full approaches on the runway, focusing on hitting the correct marks and maintaining velocity. The athlete will "pop-up" at the board rather than completing a full jump into the pit.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Find your rhythm," "Be powerful but controlled on the runway," "Hit your takeoff position."

3.  **Mid-Distance:**
    *   **Purpose:** To touch upon goal race pace, reinforcing the feel and rhythm required for the upcoming competition.
    *   **Execution:** 2 repetitions of 200m at the athlete's goal 800m race pace, with a long recovery (6-8 minutes) between.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "This is your race pace, feel the rhythm," "Stay smooth and efficient."

4.  **Long-Distance:**
    *   **Purpose:** To rehearse goal race pace in manageable chunks, building confidence without depleting energy stores.
    *   **Execution:** 2-3 repetitions of 800m at the athlete's goal 3k or 5k race pace, with a full recovery (4-5 minutes) between.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Lock into your pace," "Stay relaxed and focused," "This should feel strong and controlled."

5.  **Throwers:**
    *   **Purpose:** To take a few high-quality, full-effort throws to maintain the feeling and timing of the event.
    *   **Execution:** 4-5 full throws at 95-100% intensity. The focus is on technical execution, not maximum distance.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Execute one perfect throw at a time," "Trust your training," "Finish each throw completely."
