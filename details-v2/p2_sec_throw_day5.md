# Day 5: Recovery & Technical Refinement

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To allow for physical and mental recovery from a demanding week of training, while using low-intensity drills to refine key technical components of the throws.

### Activities:

1.  **Technical Drills (Pivoting, etc.):**
    *   **Purpose:** To practice specific parts of the throwing motion at a slow, controlled speed. This builds muscle memory and allows the athlete to focus on precise movements without the stress of a full throw.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Pivoting Drill (Discus/Shot Put):** The athlete practices the rotational footwork in the circle without an implement, focusing on balance and speed.
        *   **Standing Release Drill (All Throws):** The athlete performs the release portion of the throw from a static position, focusing on the correct body positioning and arm strike.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 10-15 minutes of focused, low-intensity drill work.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Smooth is fast," "Feel the correct positions," "Balance and control are key."

2.  **Stretching & Visualization:**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve flexibility, reduce muscle soreness, and mentally rehearse successful throws. Visualization is a powerful tool for building confidence and perfecting technique.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Stretching:** A 10-minute session of static stretching, focusing on the hips, shoulders, chest, and back.
        *   **Visualization:** The athlete spends 5 minutes quietly sitting or lying down, mentally rehearsing their perfect throw from start to finish. They should try to imagine the feeling of the movement, the flight of the implement, and the successful outcome.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One session of stretching and visualization.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Breathe deep into the stretch," "See yourself executing the perfect throw," "Imagine the feeling of a great performance."
