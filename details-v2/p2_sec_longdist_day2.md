# Day 2: Lactate Threshold

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To improve the lactate threshold, which is the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood faster than it can be cleared. Raising this threshold allows an athlete to run at a faster pace for a longer duration before fatiguing.

### Activity:

1.  **Tempo Run on Road:**
    *   **Purpose:** To stress the body's ability to clear lactate, thereby improving the lactate threshold. This is one of the most effective workouts for improving long-distance race performance.
    *   **Execution:** After a thorough warm-up, the athlete runs for 20-25 minutes at a "comfortably hard" pace. This pace is typically one where they can speak only a few words at a time. It should feel challenging and require concentration, but it should be sustainable for the entire duration. This is best done on a flat road or path to maintain a consistent effort.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous tempo run of 20-25 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Find a pace that's hard but you can hold," "Stay relaxed and focus on your rhythm," "This should feel tough, but not like an all-out race," "Concentrate on maintaining your effort."
