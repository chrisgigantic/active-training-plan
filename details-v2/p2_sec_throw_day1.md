# Day 1: Foundational Strength (Bodyweight)

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building a base of total-body strength and explosive power using fundamental bodyweight movements.

### Drills:

1.  **Tuck Jumps (T1 / T2, pg. 38):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop explosive vertical power from a two-footed stance.
    *   **Execution:** From a standing position, jump up and bring your knees as close to your chest as possible. Use your arms to help propel you upward.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 8-10 jumps.

2.  **Push-ups:**
    *   **Purpose:** To build upper body strength, particularly in the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
    *   **Execution:** Start in a high plank position with hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor, then push back up to the starting position. Keep your body in a straight line.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets to a comfortable failure (as many reps as possible with good form).

3.  **Bodyweight Squats:**
    *   **Purpose:** To build foundational lower body strength.
    *   **Execution:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Lower your hips back and down as if sitting in a chair, keeping your chest up and back straight.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 15-20 reps.
