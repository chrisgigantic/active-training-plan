# Day 2: Rotational Power & Drills

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Learning the proper release of the discus and building the foundational throwing motion from a static position.

### Drills:

1.  **Bowling Release Drill (E1, pg. 42):**
    *   **Purpose:** To learn the proper release and rotation of the discus.
    *   **Execution:** With a proper grip, the thrower takes a three-step approach to a line and "bowls" the discus ahead of them. A good release is indicated by the discus rolling for a long distance on its edge.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 10-15 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "The release should come off the index finger," "The thumb should be on top of the discus."

2.  **Standing Release Drill (E1, pg. 42):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build muscle memory for the throwing motion and perfect the release technique from a standing position.
    *   **Execution:** This is not a full throw. The thrower starts with the discus brought back and up, with the body slightly coiled at the waist. From this position, the thrower turns their hips forward towards the target and releases the discus, focusing on an "outside edge up" toss.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 10-15 repetitions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Power comes from the hips and legs, but flight comes from the upper body," "Focus on the feeling of the release."
