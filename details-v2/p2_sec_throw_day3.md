# Day 3: High-Intensity Throws

**Group:** Secondary Throwers
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To execute full throws at a high intensity, integrating the technical components, rhythm, and power developed throughout the week. This session is about putting it all together in a competition-like setting.

### Drills:

**Option 1: Full Throws on Field (if safe)**

*   **Purpose:** To practice the complete throwing sequence at maximum or near-maximum effort in a safe and controlled environment. This is the most specific form of training for a thrower.
*   **Execution:** After a thorough warm-up, the athlete takes throws using their full approach (glide or rotation). The focus should be on applying the technical cues from previous drill sessions to a full-speed throw. Ample rest should be taken between throws to ensure each attempt is of high quality.
*   **Sets/Reps:** 4-6 sets of 2-3 high-quality throws.
*   **Coaching Cues:** "Trust your technique," "Build momentum through the circle/runway," "Explode into the block and finish the throw," "Every throw has a purpose."

**Option 2: 5-Step Approach Drill (E1) (Javelin)**

*   **Purpose:** To rehearse the crucial final five steps of the javelin approach, focusing on the transition from the run-up to the powerful throwing position. This is often where a throw is made or broken.
*   **Execution:** The athlete holds the javelin correctly and begins a 5-step approach. The sequence is typically a crossover step, followed by another, leading into the final planting of the front leg and the throw. The drill focuses on maintaining speed while getting the hips ahead of the shoulders to create a powerful stretch.
*   **Sets/Reps:** 4-5 sets of 3-4 repetitions. This can be done with or without releasing the javelin, depending on the focus.
*   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep the javelin back and stable," "Hips lead, arm follows," "Plant the front foot and throw against a firm base."
