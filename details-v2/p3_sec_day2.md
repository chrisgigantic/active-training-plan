# Day 2: Full Recovery

**Group:** All Groups (Secondary)
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To allow for complete physical and mental recovery. Rest is a critical component of peak performance; this is when the body adapts to training and rebuilds itself stronger.

### Activity:

1.  **Off Day or Very Light Walk and Stretch:**
    *   **Purpose:** To maximize recovery and ensure the athlete is fully rested for the upcoming competition. An off day allows for muscle glycogen replenishment and nervous system recovery. A light walk can help reduce stiffness without causing fatigue.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Option A (Off Day):** No structured physical activity. The athlete should focus on hydration, nutrition, and getting adequate sleep.
        *   **Option B (Active Recovery):** A 15-20 minute light walk, followed by 10 minutes of gentle full-body static stretching. The intensity should be extremely low.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** N/A
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Today is about rest," "Listen to your body," "Hydrate and eat well," "Get a good night's sleep."
