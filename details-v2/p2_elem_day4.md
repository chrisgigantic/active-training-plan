**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building foundational strength, stability, and body awareness through bodyweight exercises.

### Drills:

1.  **Forward/Backward Jump & Stick (T1 / T2, pg. 6-7):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop balance, stability, and control in the lower body.
    *   **Execution (Forward):** Stand on one foot. Hop forward and "stick" the landing on the same foot, holding the position for 3 seconds. Turn around and repeat with the other foot.
    *   **Execution (Backward):** Stand on one foot. Take a moderate hop backward and stick the landing on the same foot, holding for 3 seconds. Repeat with the other foot.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 5 reps for each direction.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Maintain great body control," "Flex your knee and hip to absorb the landing," "Keep your core tight."

2.  **Animal Walks (Bear Crawl, etc.):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve total body strength, coordination, and mobility in a fun, engaging way.
    *   **Execution (Bear Crawl):** Start on hands and feet, with knees slightly bent and off the ground. Crawl forward by moving the opposite arm and leg simultaneously (e.g., right arm and left leg). Keep your back flat and hips low.
    *   **Other examples:** Crab walk, inchworm, frog jumps.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform for a set distance, like 15-20 meters, for 2-3 sets.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay low," "Keep your core engaged," "Try to be quiet."

3.  **Pillars (T1 / T2, pg. 62):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build core strength and stability.
    *   **Execution:** This is a standard plank. Pull the elbows under the shoulders, with toes pulled up toward the shins. Lift the hips so the body is in a straight line from ear to ankle.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Hold the position for 10 to 30 seconds. Complete 3 sets.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Don't let your hips drop," "Don't stick your butt in the air," "Squeeze your glutes."
