# Day 3: Maximum Velocity

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To develop and improve top-end speed. This session is about hitting the highest possible velocity and teaching the body to be efficient and relaxed while doing so.

### Drills:

1.  **Increase Acceleration Drill (E1):**
    *   **Purpose:** To specifically train the ability to accelerate once already at a high velocity, a key component of a strong 100m or 200m race. It combats the natural tendency to decelerate in the latter half of a sprint.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete will run a 100-meter sprint. The first 50 meters are performed at a fast, yet controlled, 90-95% effort. At the 50-meter mark, the athlete receives a cue (visual or auditory) and consciously increases their effort to 100%, focusing on driving their arms and legs more powerfully to accelerate through the finish line.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3-4 repetitions with very long recovery periods (5-6 minutes) to ensure the nervous system and muscles are fully recovered for a maximal effort on each repetition.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Build up your speed to the cone," "At the cone, shift into your top gear," "Finish the race faster and stronger than you started," "Stay relaxed at top speed."
