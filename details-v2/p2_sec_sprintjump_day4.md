# Day 4: Event-Specific Strength

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To build the specific strength and power needed for high-level jumping. These exercises are more intense and directly target the muscles and movements used in the takeoff and flight phases.

### Drills:

1.  **Depth Jumps (from low box) (T1):**
    *   **Purpose:** This is an advanced plyometric drill that creates a powerful stretch-reflex in the leg muscles, significantly improving vertical explosive power. It's a more intense version of the Box Drop.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete stands on a low, sturdy box (start with 12 inches and progress slowly). They step off the box, land on both feet, and immediately explode into a maximal jump onto a higher box or simply for maximum vertical height. The focus is on minimizing ground contact time and maximizing the upward explosion.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of 4-5 jumps. This is a high-intensity exercise, so quality and full recovery are more important than volume.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Be quick off the floor," "Absorb and explode," "Jump as high as you can," "Land softly on the way down."

2.  **Quarter Eagles (T2):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop quick, explosive hip rotation and balance. This is especially useful for jumpers who need to control their body's rotation during flight and landing.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete stands in an athletic, semi-squat position with arms out for balance. They jump with both feet, rotating their hips and feet a quarter turn (90 degrees) to one side, and then immediately jump back to the center. They then repeat the movement to the opposite side.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 5-6 repetitions (one rep consists of a jump to the right, back to center, to the left, and back to center).
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay light on your feet," "Keep your chest up," "Rotate with your hips, not your shoulders," "Quick, quick, quick!"
