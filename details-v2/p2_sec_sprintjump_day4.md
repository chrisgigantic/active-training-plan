# Day 4: General Strength & Mobility

**Group:** Secondary Sprint-Jump (LJ/TJ)
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building functional, total-body strength and core stability using bodyweight exercises.

### Drills:

1.  **Bodyweight Circuit (Squats, Lunges):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build lower body strength, which is the engine for sprinting and jumping.
    *   **Execution (Squats):** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Lower your hips back and down as if sitting in a chair, keeping your chest up and back straight. Go as low as you can comfortably, then drive back up to the starting position.
    *   **Execution (Lunges):** Step forward with one leg and lower your hips until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Ensure your front knee is directly above your ankle. Push off the front foot to return to the start, then repeat with the other leg.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps for each exercise.

2.  **Core: V-Sits & Supermans (T1 / T2, pg. 58, 61):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop a strong, stable core, which is critical for transferring force from the lower body to the upper body.
    *   **Execution (V Sit Ups):** Lie on your back. With hands across your chest, bring your knees and chest up at the same time, forming a "V" shape. Extend back out, but keep your shoulder blades and feet off the ground.
    *   **Execution (Supermans):** Lie flat on your stomach. Lift your arms, chest, and legs up at the same time. Hold for about two seconds, then lower back down under control.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps for V-Sits. 3 sets of 10-20 reps for Supermans.
