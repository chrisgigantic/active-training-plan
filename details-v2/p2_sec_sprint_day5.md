# Day 5: Active Recovery & Drill Refinement

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Low-intensity drills to promote recovery, refine coordination, and improve hip mobility.

### Drills:

1.  **A-March Drill (E1, pg. 14):**
    *   **Purpose:** To reinforce proper sprint posture and the mechanics of a high knee lift.
    *   **Execution:** This is a walking drill. March forward, lifting the lead knee high and keeping the toe pointed up. The action simulates the "climbing" motion over a hurdle. Exaggerate each movement to feel the stretch and activation.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 20-30 meters.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Walk tall," "Knee up, toe up, heel up," "Be deliberate with each step."

2.  **Carioca (T2, pg. 12):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve hip mobility, coordination, and lateral movement.
    *   **Execution:** Move laterally. Step the trail leg behind the lead leg, then step laterally with the lead leg. Then, bring the trail leg up and across in front of the lead leg. Repeat this "behind, side, front" sequence.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform for 15-20 yards, then switch directions. Do 2-3 sets in each direction.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Twist your hips," "Stay on the balls of your feet," "Keep it fluid."

3.  **Hurdle Mobility (No Hurdles):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve the range of motion in the hips, which is crucial for a powerful stride.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Leg Swings:** Stand next to a wall for support. Swing one leg forward and backward (10-15 times), then side to side (10-15 times). Repeat with the other leg.
        *   **Open/Close the Gate:** Walk forward. With each step, lift your knee and rotate your hip outward ("opening the gate"). On the way back, do the reverse motion, rotating the hip inward ("closing the gate").
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 1 set of each exercise.
