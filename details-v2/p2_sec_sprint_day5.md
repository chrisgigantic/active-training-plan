# Day 5: Active Recovery & Shakeout

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To promote recovery from a hard week of training while still engaging the neuromuscular system. This session helps flush out metabolic waste, reduce muscle soreness, and keep the body feeling sharp without adding significant stress.

### Drills:

1.  **Light Jogging:**
    *   **Purpose:** To increase blood flow to the muscles, which aids in the removal of waste products and delivers nutrients needed for repair. It helps transition the body from a state of high stress to recovery.
    *   **Execution:** A slow, easy, conversational-pace jog for 5-10 minutes around a field or track. The intensity should be very low.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous 5-10 minute jog.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Keep it light and easy," "Stay relaxed," "Just get the blood flowing."

2.  **Linear & Lateral Skips (T2):**
    *   **Purpose:** To maintain coordination and reinforce good posture in a low-impact manner. Skipping helps to keep the nervous system primed for explosive movements without the stress of sprinting.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Linear Skips:** The athlete skips forward for 20-30 meters, focusing on a gentle rhythm and good posture (tall chest, relaxed arms).
        *   **Lateral Skips:** The athlete skips sideways for 20-30 meters, focusing on hip mobility and coordination. Perform in both directions.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 sets of 30m for each variation (linear and lateral).
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Be light and bouncy," "Stay coordinated," "Relaxed rhythm."
