# Day 4: General Strength & Mobility

**Group:** Secondary Sprinters
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Developing explosive lateral power and comprehensive core strength.

### Drills:

1.  **Plyo: Lateral Jump & Stick (T1 / T2, pg. 8):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop first-step explosion and lateral power.
    *   **Execution:** Start standing on just your right foot. Jump off that foot to the left, landing on your left foot. Hold the landing for three seconds, maintaining balance. Then, jump back to the right, landing on your right foot.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 5 reps (one jump to each side is one rep).
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Push side to side as you jump," "Maintain a stable core," "Stick the landing."

2.  **Core: Full Circuit (Pillars, V-Sits):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build a strong, resilient core that can handle the forces of sprinting.
    *   **Execution (Pillars):** Hold a standard plank position (body in a straight line from ear to ankle) for 20-30 seconds. You can also include side pillars.
    *   **Execution (V Sit Ups):** Lie on your back. Bring your knees and chest up at the same time to form a "V" shape. Lower back down but keep feet and shoulders off the ground.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** Perform as a circuit. 3 sets of 20-30 second holds for Pillars, and 3 sets of 15-20 reps for V-Sits.
