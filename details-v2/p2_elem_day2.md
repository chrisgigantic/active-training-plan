# Day 2: Speed Endurance Foundation

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To introduce the concept of speed endurance by running sprints of decreasing distance. This helps young athletes learn to maintain a high level of effort and finish strong through fatigue.

### Drills:

1.  **"Cut-Down" Sprints on Field:**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach pacing and the ability to maintain quality sprint form even when tired. The decreasing distance allows for high-quality repetitions.
    *   **Execution:** Mark off distances of 80m, 60m, and 40m on a field. The athlete sprints 80m at a strong, controlled pace (around 90-95% effort). After a full recovery walk back, they sprint 60m, and after another full recovery, they sprint the final 40m at maximum effort.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 1-2 sets of the 80-60-40m sequence. Full recovery (walking back to the start and resting for 2-3 minutes) is crucial between each sprint.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Run tall and relaxed on the 80," "Stay strong through the 60," "Explode and finish fast on the 40!"
