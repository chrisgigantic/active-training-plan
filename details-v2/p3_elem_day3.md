# Day 3: Neurological Priming

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To "wake up" the nervous system with very short, fast movements. This helps the young athletes feel sharp and bouncy, preparing their bodies for a fast effort without causing any tiredness.

### Activities:

1.  **Short Warm-up:**
    *   **Purpose:** To get the muscles warm and ready for the main activity without using up energy.
    *   **Execution:** A brief, 5-8 minute warm-up consisting of a lap of light jogging, followed by a few dynamic drills like high knees, butt kicks, and leg swings.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Just a quick warm-up to get ready," "Let's get moving!"

2.  **20m Run-ins:**
    *   **Purpose:** To activate the fast-twitch muscle fibers and make the athlete feel quick and explosive.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete takes a running start ("run-in") from about 10 meters back and sprints at a fast, bouncy, and relaxed pace for 20 meters. The entire effort is very short and focuses on feeling light and springy.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2 repetitions with a full walk-back recovery.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Feel light on your feet," "Be quick and bouncy," "Let's see your fast feet!"
