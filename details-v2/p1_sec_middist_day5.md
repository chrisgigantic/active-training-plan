# Day 5: Active Recovery & Form

**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Promoting recovery with a light run while reinforcing efficient running mechanics.

### Drills:

1.  **Easy Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** To facilitate recovery, increase blood flow to the muscles, and add to the weekly mileage base without adding significant stress.
    *   **Execution:** A short, very easy run at a conversational pace.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 15-20 minutes continuous.

2.  **Fast Leg Run Drill (T1 / T2, pg. 37):**
    *   **Purpose:** To improve neuromuscular coordination and practice a quick, efficient leg cycle.
    *   **Execution:** While jogging forward, alternate between a slow jogging motion and a "fast leg" step. The fast leg is an exaggerated running motion with one leg, bringing the knee up to waist height, pulling the heel into your rear end, and quickly dropping it back down.
    *   **Progression:**
        *   **Beginner:** Fast leg every 8th step, using the same leg. Switch legs on the next repetition.
        *   **Intermediate:** Fast leg every 5th step, alternating legs.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 2-3 repetitions over 30-40 yards.
