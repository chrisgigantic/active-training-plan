**Group:** Secondary Mid-Distance
**Phase:** General Physical Preparedness (Weeks 1-2)

---

### Focus:
Building essential full-body strength and a robust core to improve running economy and prevent injury.

### Drills:

1.  **Bodyweight Circuit (Squats, Lunges):**
    *   **Purpose:** To build lower body and glute strength, which provides the power for an efficient stride.
    *   **Execution (Squats):** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Lower your hips back and down, keeping your chest up.
    *   **Execution (Lunges):** Step forward and lower your hips until both knees are at a 90-degree angle. Push back to the start and alternate legs.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of 15-20 reps for each exercise.

2.  **Core Circuit (Pillars, Side Pillars, Leg Lifts) (T2, pg. 59, 62):**
    *   **Purpose:** To develop 360-degree core stability.
    *   **Execution (Pillars/Side Pillars):** Hold a standard front plank (on elbows) and then a plank on each side. Keep the body in a straight line.
    *   **Execution (Leg Lifts):** Lie on your back. Lift your legs off the ground and hold them in the air. For more difficulty, put your arms over your chest.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets: Hold each pillar for 30-45 seconds. Hold leg lifts for 15-20 seconds.
