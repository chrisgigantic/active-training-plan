# Day 5: Competition Day

**Group:** Elementary Sprinters
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To provide a fun, positive, and low-stress competitive experience. The goal is for the athletes to enjoy themselves, try their best, and feel proud of the skills they have learned.

### Activity:

1.  **Fun Meet on Field:**
    *   **Purpose:** To celebrate the end of the training block with a fun competition that allows the athletes to showcase their progress.
    *   **Execution:**
        *   **Warm-up:** A standard group warm-up led by the coach, just like a real meet.
        *   **Events:** Host a couple of simple events, such as a 40m Dash and a Standing Long Jump.
        *   **Structure:** Organize the athletes into heats for the run and give everyone 2-3 attempts at the jump. Keep the atmosphere light and encouraging.
        *   **Celebrate:** After the events, gather the athletes to celebrate their efforts. This isn't about winning, but about participation and trying their best.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Show everyone how fast you've gotten!" "Remember to have fun," "The most important thing is to try your hardest," "Let's cheer for all our friends!"
