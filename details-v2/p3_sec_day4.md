# Day 4: Pre-Meet Shakeout

**Group:** All Groups (Secondary)
**Phase:** Competition (Weeks 6-7)

---

### Focus:
To perform a very light, brief session the day before a competition to stay loose, reinforce positive movement patterns, and calm any pre-race nerves. This is not a workout, but a final preparation step.

### Activities:

1.  **Light Jog:**
    *   **Purpose:** To get the blood flowing and gently warm up the muscles.
    *   **Execution:** 5-10 minutes of very slow, easy jogging.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Nice and easy, just shaking out the legs."

2.  **2-3 Key Drills:**
    *   **Purpose:** To mentally and physically reinforce one or two key technical feelings for the athlete's event.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete performs a few repetitions of 2-3 familiar, low-intensity drills. For example, a sprinter might do A-skips, a jumper might do some leg swings, and a thrower might do some standing release motions.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Smooth and perfect reps," "Focus on that good feeling."

3.  **2-4 Strides:**
    *   **Purpose:** To finish the session feeling fast, sharp, and ready for the next day.
    *   **Execution:** 2-4 strides of 60-80 meters on a soft surface like grass. The athlete gradually accelerates to a fast but relaxed pace (around 80-85% effort) and then smoothly decelerates.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Stay smooth and relaxed," "Feel the bounce in your step," "Fast and easy."
