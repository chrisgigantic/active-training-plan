# Day 1: Aerobic Support

**Group:** Secondary Long-Distance
**Phase:** Specific Physical Preparedness (Weeks 3-5)

---

### Focus:
To continue building the aerobic engine, which is the cornerstone of long-distance running. This steady run improves cardiovascular efficiency, muscular endurance, and the body's ability to use oxygen effectively.

### Activity:

1.  **Moderate Run:**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a sustained aerobic stimulus that enhances endurance and supports the more intense workouts later in the week. It builds the foundation needed to handle higher training volumes and intensities.
    *   **Execution:** The athlete performs a continuous run for 30-40 minutes at a steady, conversational pace. The effort should be consistent and controlled, not strenuous. This run is best done on varied terrain like roads or trails to build strength, but a track or field is also suitable.
    *   **Sets/Reps:** One continuous run of 30-40 minutes.
    *   **Coaching Cues:** "Settle into a rhythm you can hold for the whole time," "Focus on relaxed, efficient form," "Breathing should be deep and regular," "This is about building your engine."
